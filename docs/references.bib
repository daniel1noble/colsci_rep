	abstract = {Wolbachia are a group of maternally inherited bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods. Wolbachia infections are known to result in the expression of various abnormal reproductive phenotypes, the best known being cytoplasmic incompatibility. The first systematic survey of 42 spider mite species in Japan revealed that seven species (16.7\%) were infected with Wolbachia. Wolbachia in the spider mites were grouped into three subgroups in supergroup B by phylogenetic analyses of the wsp gene. Most spider mites did not show cytoplasmic incompatibility when infected males were crossed with uninfected females. However, all infected populations of Panonychus mori and Oligonychus gotohi ( five and four populations, respectively) possessed modification-positive strains of Wolbachia, and the cytoplasmic incompatibility decreased egg hatchability and female ratio of the spider mites. Thus, some Wolbachia strains cause sex ratio distortion in their hosts.},

	abstract = {Colors in feathers are produced by pigment deposition or by nanostructures within barbs or barbules. In the absence of pigments or nanostructures, light is scattered incoherently, producing white coloration. Honest advertisement models predict that ornamental colors evolve if they reliably signal individual properties such as viability, health, or nutritional state. In this study, we tested if (1) iridescent structural and (2) unpigmented plumage coloration signal male quality in the Blue-black Grassquit (Volatinia jacarina). During three reproductive seasons, we captured males and measured morphological variables and nuptial plumage coverage, and collected feathers for spectrometry. We found that saturation of the iridescent coloration was positively related to relative molting speed, indicating that males investing more in prenuptial molt also produced more saturated, {UV}-shifted plumage. Body condition was not related to brightness or saturation of the iridescent plumage, and no male morphological attributes were associated with the white underwing patch coloration or size. Our results suggest that patterns of molt, and possibly feather growth, may affect the organization of optical nanostructures responsible for iridescent coloration, and that the ontogeny of iridescent plumage ornaments must be taken into account in hypotheses concerning honest advertisement of such signals. Thus, coloration in this species may reliably reflect energy allocation to molting, constituting an honest indicator of male quality, life history decisions, or endocrine state. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural variation in molting pattern being associated with sexually-selected structural color plumage.},

	abstract = {1. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which parasites can affect the expression of ornamental traits. 2. Levels of an intestinal coccidian parasite, Isospora lacazei, were manipulated in captive male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris) by suppressing the natural infections with a coccidiostatic sulphonamide drug. Subsequently, half the birds were experimentally infected, while another half continued receiving medication. 3. Over the course of the experiment the effect of our treatments upon 14 mainly haemato-serological condition indices was recorded. Additionally, changes in colour and carotenoid content of yellow tail and breast feathers, which serve as sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, were measured. 4. Eighty-nine per cent of birds hosted chronic isosporan infection before the experiment, yet experimental inoculation with mixed parasite strains resulted in drastic but transient decreases in serum carotenoid, vitamin E, triglyceride and albumin concentrations, and reduced body mass, indicating serious pathology and probable nutrient malabsorption due to damaged intestinal epithelium. 5. Laboratory-grown tail feathers of infected birds contained 52\% less carotenoids and also had smaller values of chroma and hue than those of medicated birds. 6. These results suggest that coccidian infection reduced the expression of plumage coloration by creating a deficiency of carotenoids available for deposition in ornamental feathers.},

	abstract = {Colours in feathers are produced by pigments or by nanostructurally organized tissues that interact with light. One of the simplest nanostructures is a single layer of keratin overlying a linearly organized layer of melanosomes that create iridescent colours of feather barbules through thin-film interference. Recently, it has been hypothesized that glossy (i.e. high specular reflectance) black feathers may be evolutionarily intermediate between matte black and iridescent feathers, and thus have a smooth keratin layer that produces gloss, but not the layered organization of melanosomes needed for iridescence. However, the morphological bases of glossiness remain unknown. Here, we use a theoretical approach to generate predictions about morphological differences between matte and glossy feathers that we then empirically test. Thin-film models predicted that glossy spectra would result from a keratin layer 110-180 nm thick and a melanin layer greater than 115 nm thick. Transmission electron microscopy data show that nanostructure of glossy barbules falls well within that range, but that of matte barbules does not. Further, glossy barbules had a thinner and more regular keratin cortex, as well as a more continuous underlying melanin layer, than matte barbules. Thus, their quasi-ordered nanostructures are morphologically intermediate between matte black and iridescent feathers, and perceived gloss may be a form of weakly chromatic iridescence.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that cause various reproduction alterations in their hosts, including cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), an incompatibility between sperm and egg that typically results in embryonic death. We investigate theoretically the effects of Wolbachia‐induced bidirectional {CI} on levels of divergence between two populations, where there is migration in both directions and differential selection at a single locus. The main findings are as follows: Wolbachia differences in the two populations are maintained up to a threshold migration rate, above which the system collapses to a single Wolbachia type; differential selection at a nuclear locus increases the threshold migration rate below which Wolbachia polymorphisms are maintained; Wolbachia differences between the populations enhance their genetic divergence at the selected locus by reducing the “effective migration rate,” and even moderate levels of {CI} can cause large population differences in allele frequencies; and asymmetric {CI} can induce strong asymmetries in effective migration rate and dramatically alter the pattern of genetic divergence compared with the No Wolbachia situation. We derive an analytical approximation for the effective migration rate, which matches the simulation results for most parameter values. These results generally support the view that {CI} Wolbachia can contribute to genetic divergence between populations.},

	abstract = {Unlike the majority birds that replace their primaries once each year, most Sterna terns practice an unusual repeated wing molt, wherein a variable number of inner primaries are replaced twice or even three times in a single year. This seemingly redundant replacement of the primaries may serve as a sexually selected indicator of quality in that terns may evaluate potential mates based on the number of primaries they were able to replace twice or three times prior to the breeding season. To evaluate the potential of repeated molt as a social signal, we compared light-reflectance curves and photon catches for new (twice-molted) and old (once-molted) primaries in three species of terns. We observed that old feathers reflected considerably less light across all wavelengths and found that in two of the three species examined the ultraviolet reflectance was disproportionably reduced in old feathers relative to the reduction in visible reflectance. Thus, the {UV} component of coloration in tern wing feathers may accentuate the difference between the new feathers generated by repeated wing molt and older, more worn feathers, thereby reinforcing a sexually selected signal of quality.},

	abstract = {The control mechanisms and information content of melanin-based colourations are still debated among evolutionary biologists. Recent hypotheses contend that molecules involved in melanogenesis alter other physiological processes, thereby generating covariation between melanin-based colouration and other phenotypic attributes. Interestingly, several molecules such as agouti and glutathione that trigger the production of reddish-brown pheomelanin have an inhibitory effect on the production of black/grey eumelanin, whereas other hormones, such as melanocortins, have the opposite effect. We therefore propose the hypothesis that phenotypic traits positively correlated with the degree of eumelanin-based colouration may be negatively correlated with the degree of pheomelanin-based colouration, or vice versa. Given the role played by the melanocortin system and glutathione on melanogenesis and resistance to oxidative stress, we examined the prediction that resistance to oxidative stress is positively correlated with the degree of black colouration but negatively with the degree of reddish colouration. Using the barn owl (Tyto alba) as a model organism, we swapped eggs between randomly chosen nests to allocate genotypes randomly among environments and then we measured resistance to oxidative stress using the {KRL} assay in nestlings raised by foster parents. As predicted, the degree of black and reddish pigmentations was positively and negatively correlated, respectively, with resistance to oxidative stress. Our results reveal that eumelanin-and pheomelanin-based colourations can be redundant signals of resistance to oxidative stress.},

Observations of wing scales using an optical microscope revealed that light was reflected from the inter-ridge regions, where transmission electron microscopy revealed a multilayer structure. Based on the multilayer dimensions obtained, three models were devised and compared to explain the measured reflectance spectrum. The results showed that the best fit is a model in which thicknesses of thin films of the multilayer system are not constant and air spaces between cuticle layers are more or less packed with cuticle spacers. This suggests that the specific wing colors of the species examined are produced by the species-specific arrangement of the multilayer structure of wing scales.},

In most cases, little is known about the identity and visual sensory abilities of the correct receiver and the precise location at which interactions take place in the field, in particular for mimetic systems. In this study, we focused on Misumena vatia, a crab spider meeting the criteria for assessing crypsis better than many other models, and claimed to use colour changes for both aggressive and protective crypsis. We carried out a systematic field survey to quantitatively assess the exactness of background colour matching in M. vatia with respect to the visual system of many of its receivers within the community. We applied physiological models of bird, bee and blowfly colour vision, using flower and spider spectral reflectances measured with a spectroradiometer. We observed that crypsis at long distance is systematically achieved, exclusively through achromatic contrast, in both bee and bird visions. At short distance, M. vatia is mostly chromatically detectable, whatever the substrate, for bees and birds. However, spiders can be either poorly discriminable or quite visible depending on the substrate for bees. Spiders are always chromatically undetectable for blowflies. We discuss the biological relevance of these results in both defensive and aggressive contexts of crypsis within a community sensory perspective.},

	abstract = {Developmental constraints and trade-offs can limit diversity, but organisms have repeatedly evolved morphological innovations that overcome these limits by expanding the range and functionality of traits. Iridescent colours in birds are commonly produced by melanin-containing organelles (melanosomes) organized into nanostructured arrays within feather barbules. Variation in array type (e.g. multilayers and photonic crystals, {PCs}) is known to have remarkable effects on plumage colour, but the optical consequences of variation in melanosome shape remain poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of spectrophotometric, experimental and theoretical methods to test how melanosome hollowness—a morphological innovation largely restricted to birds—affects feather colour. Optical analyses of hexagonal close-packed arrays of hollow melanosomes in two species, wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and violet-backed starlings (Cinnyricinclus leucogaster), indicated that they function as two-dimensional {PCs}. Incorporation of a larger dataset and optical modelling showed that, compared with solid melanosomes, hollow melanosomes allow birds to produce distinct colours with the same energetically favourable, close-packed configurations. These data suggest that a morphological novelty has, at least in part, allowed birds to achieve their vast morphological and colour diversity.},

They cause three kinds of reproductive alterations in their hosts: cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. There have been many studies of the distribution of Wolbachia in arthropods, but very few crustacean species are known to be infected. We investigated the prevalence of Wolbachia in 85 species from five crustacean orders. Twenty-two isopod species were found to carry these bacteria. The bacteria were found mainly in terrestrial species, suggesting that Wolbachia came from a continental environment. The evolutionary relationships between these Wolbachia strains were determined by sequencing bacterial genes and by interspecific transfers. All the bacteria associated with isopods belonged to the Wolbachiae B group, based on 16S {rDNA} sequence data. All the terrestrial isopod symbionts in this group except one formed an independent clade. The results of interspecific transfers show evidence of specialization of Wolbachia symbionts to their isopod hosts. They also suggest that host species plays a more important role than bacterial phylogeny in determining the phenotype induced by Wolbachia infection.},

	abstract = {Sending color signals to conspecifics may attract predators, leading to opposing selection pressures on the evolution of signal expression and display behavior in animals. The costs of signaling can be reduced, however, because conspicuousness is the combined result of the reflectance spectra of the displayer's color pattern and the spectra of ambient light illuminating the animal. Changes in ambient light can alter conspicuousness, even when chemical and structural color-generating mechanisms remain constant, potentially allowing animals to display their colors most fully in light environments where the benefits are greatest relative to the costs. Using spectroradiometric methods, we determined how light habitat use affects conspicuousness in adult males of the Wire-tailed Manakin Pipra filicauda, a lekking bird species with vivid plumage colors. We studied three aspects of visibility, including properties of the entire color pattern, visual contrast within an individual's plumage and a bird's contrast relative to its visual background. Wire-tailed Manakins usually displayed in forest shade environments, which reduced their conspicuousness at larger viewing distances, while maximizing visual contrast within the plumage color pattern at close viewing distances. Compared to sunspots, ambient light in forest shade reduces the contrast of individual bird colors with the background at close viewing distance. However, background contrast of individual bird colors in the shade was still relatively higher during sunny than during cloudy weather which may explain why males were more active when the sun was not blocked by clouds. Assuming that the visual perceptions of predators and other manakins do not differ from the reflectance patterns we measured, Wire-tailed manakins tend to display in light environments that reduce the conflicts between avoiding long distance detection by predators and displaying conspicuous color signals to visiting females.},

In this article we show that N. clavipes spin silks of varying spectral properties in response to both the intensity and spectral composition of its light environment. In bright light characterized by broad irradiance spectra, N. clavipes produce a complex of yellow pigments that absorb light of wavelengths less than 500 nm, making their webs appear golden. In dim light and where wavelengths less than 500 nm have been eliminated, N. clavipes produce pigments that reflect light between 400 and 500 nm, making their webs appear white. Because yellow serves as a superstimulus attracting both herbivorous and pollinating insects, yellow silks may attract prey to spider webs. By training Trigona fluviventris, a stingless bee commonly fed on by N. clavipes, to forage at an artificial feeding site, we found that silk color affects insect response in two ways. First, yellow webs attract and intercept T. fluviventris more frequently than webs of any other color. Second, even after being intercepted once, T. fluviventris have difficulty learning to avoid yellow webs. We propose that N. clavipes has evolved a foraging behavior that makes use of the color cues insects seek while foraging and that the broad distribution of N. clavipes results from the spiders' ability to adjust the reflectance properties of its silks relative to its local light environment, allowing spiders to make use of whatever local populations of prey are most abundant.},

Male ornament evolution in the wild may depend much more on the social environment and behavioural flexibility through learning than was previously thought for non-social invertebrates. The predictive power of these results points to a pressing need for theoretical models of sexual selection that incorporate effects of social experience.},

The dark-adapted dorsal ocellus does not contain a homogeneous population of sensory receptors.

Sensitivity at shorter wavelengths (near-ultraviolet and blue), however, involves the stimulation of both this and a near-ultraviolet-sensitive receptor with a maximum sensitivity at about 370 nm. Anatomically, the sensory cells of the dorsal ocellus of Tenodera were determined histologically to be grouped into two distinct regions, each group making its own separate contribution to the ocellar nerve.

	abstract = {Females of the genus Xiphophorus, which includes unsworded platyfish and sworded swordtails, share a mating preference which favours a sword despite phylogenetic evidence that the sword was not present in the evolutionary history of platyfish. A recent molecular phylogeny, however, proposes that the platyfish arose from within the swordtails. If this is the case, the preference for a sword in platyfish may be a retained ancestral preference rather than a bias that evolved before the first appearance of the sword. To determine whether or not the preference favouring a sword is an ancestral bias present before the evolution of the sword, I tested sword preferences in the sister genus, Priapella, which lacks a sword: female P. olmecae were found to prefer conspecific males with artificial swords to those without swords. These results suggest that a pre-existing bias favouring a sword arose before the divergence of these two genera, and thus before the appearance of a sword. In addition, the strength of the preference exhibited by P. olmecae females for a sword was found to vary with sword length; as the length of the sword was increased, the strength of the preference increased. Female P. olmecae, therefore, prefer males with longer swords to males with shorter swords. This increasing preference with sword length is similar to the preference of green swordtails, suggesting that the preference has a common basis in the two groups. More generally, this work further establishes the pre-existing bias model as a viable explanation for the evolution of female preferences and male traits.},

However, the ability of this sensitive species to evolve under seasonally varying subtropical areas is largely unknown. D. ananassae flies are mostly lighter during the rainy season but darker and lighter flies occur in the autumn season in northern India. We tested the hypothesis whether seasonally varying alternative body color phenotypes of D. ananassae vary in their levels of environmental stress tolerances and mating behavior. Thus, we investigated D. ananassae flies collected during rainy and autumn seasons for changes in body melanization and their genetic basis, desiccation-related traits, cold tolerance and mating propensity. On the basis of genetic crosses, we found total body color dimorphism consistent with a single gene model in both sexes of D. ananassae. A significant increase in the frequency of the dark morph was observed during the drier autumn season, and body color phenotypes showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which suggests climatic selection plays a role. Resistance to desiccation as well as cold stress were two- to three-fold higher in the dark body color strain as compared with the light strain. On the basis of no-choice mating experiments, we observed significantly higher assortative matings between dark morphs under desiccation or cold stress, and between light morphs under hot or higher humidity conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the ecological significance of seasonally varying total body color dimorphism in a tropical species, D. ananassae.},

The pigment determining blue and green egg colors is an antioxidant whose availability for eggshell coloring may be limited. To test the signaling function on a species with blue eggs, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, we measured egg color with a spectrophotometer on the day of laying and obtained two principal components from their reflectance spectra that together explained 99\% of variation and represented shell lightness, and hue and saturation, respectively. We also measured female immunocompetence during the nestling period through the response to phytohemagglutinin as a measure of cell-mediated immunity and the response to a tetanus vaccination as a measure of Immoral immunity. The total amount of immunoglobulins in blood of females and of nestlings before fledging was also estimated. Mean within-clutch egg darkness was positively associated with both measures of female immunocompetence, while better female condition was associated with colors tending away from intermediate and toward short wavelengths. Ageing female laid lighter eggs. The mean within-brood level of nestling {IgY} was also associated with mean within-clutch egg colors tending away from intermediate and toward short wavelengths. Mean egg darkness decreased linearly during the laying sequence, suggesting pigment limitation. Males were observed frequently visiting nests during the laying period, allowing them to observe eggs before the start of incubation. These results support the signaling hypothesis for explaining bright colors of avian eggs.},

Females would benefit from mating with more ornamented males if males' ornamentation signals their health status and ability to provide parasite resistance genes for the offspring. Carotenoid-based plumage coloration of birds has been hypothesised to honestly reflect an individual's health status due to trade-off in allocation of carotenoids between maintenance and signalling functions. The prediction of this hypothesis, namely that individuals with brighter plumage are able to mount stronger immune responses against novel antigens and reveal generally better health state, was tested in captive male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris). Greenfinches with brighter yellow breast feathers showed stronger humoral immune response against novel antigen ({SRBC}) while no relationship between plumage coloration and an estimate of cell-mediated immune responsiveness ({PHA} response) was detected. Elaborately ornamented individuals had better general health state as indicated by the negative correlations between plumage brightness and heterophil haemoconcentration. Consistent with the concept of {PMSS}, these results suggest that carotenoid-based plumage coloration in greenfinches honestly signals immunocompetence and health status.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that cause a number of reproductive alterations in insects, including cytoplasmic incompatibility(1,2), an incompatibility between sperm and egg that results in loss of sperm chromosomes following fertilization. Wolbachia are estimated to infect 15-20\% of all insect species(3), and also are common in arachnids, isopods and nematodes(3,4). Therefore, Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility could be an important factor promoting rapid speciation in invertebrates(5), although this contention is controversial(6,7). Here we show that high levels of bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility between two closely related species of insects (the parasitic wasps Nasonia giraulti and Nasonia longicornis) preceded the evolution of other postmating reproductive barriers. The presence of Wolbachia severely reduces the frequency of hybrid offspring in interspecies crosses. However, antibiotic curing of the insects results in production of hybrids. Furthermore, F-1 and F-2 hybrids are completely viable and fertile, indicating the absence of F-1 and F-2 hybrid breakdown. Partial interspecific sexual isolation occurs, yet it is asymmetric and incomplete. Our results indicate that Wolbachia-induced reproductive isolation occurred in the early stages of speciation in this system, before the evolution of other postmating isolating mechanisms (for example, hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility).},

Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned turkeys to three experimental groups: we maintained six turkeys free of coccidial infection, inoculated four turkeys with a single species of coccidial oocvsts, and inoculated six turkeys with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of wing covert and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male turkeys such that infected males showed proportionately less {UV} reflectance in their wing covert and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild turkeys, iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health.},

Simultaneously, a case study was conducted in Hsinchu Fishing Port of north-western Taiwan. Based on the aforementioned models, three primary producer species, Ahnfeltiopsis flabelliformis, Chondrus ocellatus and Sarcodia montagneana, were chosen as the indicator species which had the highest co-occurrence probabilities and showed greater tolerance to more critical environment. It is imperative to understand how the three species under particular co-occurring conditions and environmental factors influence the composition of sessile assemblages in coastal water. The results indicate that for the purpose of increasing biodiversity, these models are feasible to find indicator species of artificial structures, and to help make it possible to design coastal structures based on biological considerations. This study provides an innovative approach for further advanced application in the artificial habitat of coast management.},

For animals that rely on crypsis to avoid predators, one solution is to alter their behaviour or appearance to maximize crypsis in ways that are specific to different types of predator. We tested whether dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion transvaalense) showed different behavioural responses, including colour change, towards multiple predators (bird and snake models) that detect and capture prey in different ways, and whether these antipredator responses varied geographically. Chameleons consistently used the same body postures (lateral compression and flipping to the opposite side of the branch) and displayed similar chromatic (colour) contrast against the natural background in response to both predator types. However, they became significantly more achromatically contrasting (brighter) in the presence of the snake compared to the bird. This relative difference in achromatic contrast towards the two types of predator was consistent among populations. There were also significant differences in both absolute achromatic and chromatic contrast among populations despite very similar light environment, background coloration and habitat structure. Our results highlight facultative crypsis as one type of flexible antipredator tactic and emphasize the importance of visual ecology in understanding prey-predator interactions.

An alternative, but not exclusive, function of bare part color may be signaling readiness to breed, especially in colonial, asynchronous breeders. White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) are colonial waterbirds that show vivid bare part colors on their bills and legs during reproduction. We quantified bill and leg colors to describe color changes and their possible relationship to reproductive status during the breeding season of White Ibises in the Florida Everglades from 1998 to 2001. We also examined the correlation between bare part colors and circulating concentrations of sex steroids to understand the factors that regulate bare part colors. During the display stage, male and female ibises developed dark pink bills and scarlet legs. As the breeding season progressed, bills and legs faded and developed a muted pink hue. The bare part colors of female ibises were correlated with testosterone concentrations, but those of male ibises were not correlated with any hormones. A discriminant function analysis based on principal component scores (representing variation in saturation and hue) and the amount of black on the bill successfully classified ibis reproductive stage 94\% of the time. The use of bare part colors to determine reproductive status may be useful for studying reproduction in colonially nesting birds, where access to breeding sites can be difficult and potential for researcher disturbance is high.},

Using modern oxygen minimum zones as an analog for Proterozoic oceans, we explore the effect of low oxygen levels on the feeding ecology of polychaetes, the dominant macrofaunal animals in deep-sea sediments. Here we show that low oxygen is clearly linked to low proportions of carnivores in a community and low diversity of carnivorous taxa, whereas higher oxygen levels support more complex food webs. The recognition of a physiological control on carnivory therefore links environmental triggers and ecological drivers, providing an integrated explanation for both the pattern and timing of Cambrian animal radiation.},

Here we investigated Wolbachia infections in bean beetles from the world, representing seven genera, 20 species and 87 populations. Of 20 species examined, Wolbachia infections were detected in four species, Megabruchidius sophorae, Callosobruchus analis, C. latealbus and C. chinensis. Infection frequencies were partial in M. sophorae but perfect in the other species. In addition to C. chinensis described in the previous studies, C. latealbus was infected with two distinct Wolbachia strains. These Wolbachia strains from the bean beetles were phylogenetically not closely related to each other. Among world populations of C. chinensis, some Taiwanese populations on a wild leguminous plant, Rhynchosia minima, exhibited a peculiar Wolbachia infection pattern, suggesting the possibility that these populations comprise a distinct host race or a cryptic species.},

	abstract = {Much of the literature on male–female coevolution concerns the processes by which male traits and female preferences for these can coevolve and be maintained by selection. There has been less explicit focus on the origin of male traits and female preferences. Here, I argue that it is important to distinguish origin from subsequent coevolution and that insights into the origin can help us appreciate the relative roles of various coevolutionary processes for the evolution of diversity in sexual dimorphism. I delineate four distinct scenarios for the origin of male traits and female preferences that build on past contributions, two of which are based on pre-existing variation in quality indicators among males and two on exploitation of pre-existing sensory biases among females. Recent empirical research, and theoretical models, suggest that origin by sensory exploitation has been widespread. I argue that this points to a key, but perhaps transient, role for sexually antagonistic coevolution ({SAC}) in the subsequent evolutionary elaboration of sexual traits, because (i) sensory exploitation is often likely to be initially costly for individuals of the exploited sex and (ii) the subsequent evolution of resistance to sensory exploitation should often be associated with costs due to selective constraints. A review of a few case studies is used to illustrate these points. Empirical data directly relevant to the costs of being sensory exploited and the costs of evolving resistance is largely lacking, and I stress that such data would help determining the general importance of sexual conflict and {SAC} for the evolution of sexual dimorphism.},

	abstract = {Many male insects aggressively defend specific perching sites containing larval resources. There are three main explanations for how this behaviour could contribute to increased matings: perching males may aim to encounter (1) eclosing or freshly eclosed virgin females, (2) previously mated, ovipositing females, or (3) receptive females that visit these sites either specifically to mate or for other reasons. I evaluated these hypotheses by investigating the timing of post-eclosion female receptivity and the extent of polyandry within an Australian population of the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). This species represents the group of butterflies in which males defend specific, geographically prominent, sites that overlap with the distribution of larval resources. Freshly emerged female H. bolina refrained from mating until their ovaries were close to maturation, resulting in a pre-mating period of 4-8 days. The presence of this substantial refractory period rules out the hypothesis that males defend pupation sites with the aim of mating with eclosing or freshly eclosed females. Secondly, almost 90\% of females within the studied population carried only one spermatophore, a finding that mediates against the possibility that most perching males target (already mated) ovipositing females. The 'rendezvous-site' hypothesis is the most likely general explanation for territoriality in H. bolina; however, it remains unclear whether the distribution of larval hostplants per se has a primary influence on territory selection by males in this species.},

	abstract = {Bird song is a prominent example of a trait under inter- and intrasexual selection. Performance-related aspects of bird song have been shown to vary among males and to influence territorial interactions as well as female mate choice. In oscine songbirds, song is different from many other sexually selected traits in that it is learned. As a result of learning, territorial neighbors share songs in some species. Thus, social interactions may be influenced not only by how well a male performs song but also by whom he shares song with. Here, we test the hypothesis that song sharing indicates local song learning and experience from which females may benefit. We examine the prediction that song sharing correlates with reproductive success. During our 4-year field study on white-crowned sparrows Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis, we found that yearling males that shared song with at least one territorial neighbor had higher social mating success than nonsharers. At the same time, song performance did not significantly correlate with social mating success but did correlate with paternity loss. Males with high performance were more likely to lose paternity than males with low performance. No song feature correlated with gaining paternity. We conclude that song sharing may be an indicator of male quality and stable social neighborhoods which may be a direct benefit to females. Furthermore, our results may provide a functional explanation for a developmental process where songbirds adjust their song to the local social neighborhood.},

We found that these birds prefer colours that contrast with their own plumage, the bower structure and the visual backgrounds adjacent to the bower, and that they have very strong dislikes for colours that are similar to their own plumage and to the visual backgrounds. The range of disliked colour hues was much narrower than the range of preferred hues, suggesting that the word 'preference' may be misleading. Preferences for colour are inherently multidimensional and should be studied in the context of their function. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Carotenoids produce the brilliant red, orange, and yellow colors of many animals. However, melanin pigments can also confer some of these same hues. Because carotenoid and melanin colors are produced in different ways and may serve different signaling functions, either within or between species, it is important to establish whether one or both types of pigment are responsible for coloration. We have discovered what appears to be an evolutionary switch from carotenoid- to melanin-based color in two sexually dichromatic New World orioles. Using a combination of reflectance spectrometry and chromatographic analyses of plumage pigments, we found that the chestnut plumage of adult male orchard orioles Icterus spurius is produced predominantly by phaeomelanins. Orchard oriole feathers also contain carotenoids, which appear to be masked by the high concentration of phaeomelanins. In contrast, both carotenoids and phaeomelanins appear to contribute to color in adult male Fuertes's orioles I. fuertesi. Moreover, yellow yearling male and female plumage in both species is produced by carotenoids alone. The masking of carotenoids with phaeomelanins in orchard orioles is interesting in light of the signaling roles that carotenoids are thought to play. In addition, these plumage differences produce a unique case of age and sexual pigment dimorphism in orchard and Fuertes's orioles.},

The bird then lofts high into the air to make repeated dives. The azimuthal component of this dive is always oriented into the sun when the sky is clear. This orientation enhances the display value of the iridescent plumage of the male with respect to the stimulus object. Under overcast conditions the orientation of dives is no longer sun oriented. A single observation suggests that when bright shadows are lacking but the location of the sun is clear, orientation fails. This suggests the possibility that the orientation of the dive is based upon shadows. A sun-oriented display is most likely to evolve in species which have iridescent plumage and breed at high latitudes or in the winter months. The Anna's Hummingbird meets all of these criteria and is, as far as is known, the only species of hummingbird which orients its display with respect to the sun.},

Plants can increase signal efficacy by enhancing chromatic (wavelength related) and/or achromatic (intensity related) contrasts between fruit and background. To assess how these contrasts determine the detectability of fruit signals, we conducted 2 experiments with free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under seminatural conditions in a 2025 m(2) aviary. Crows searched first for artificial red and black fruits and detected red fruits from a larger distance. Because artificial red fruits had higher chromatic and lower achromatic contrasts against foliage than artificial black fruits, crows apparently prioritized chromatic contrasts. Thus, the common change in fruit color from red to black during ripening does not increase signal efficacy to crows. In a second trial, crows searched for {UV}-reflecting and black blueberries (Vaccinum myrtillus) against backgrounds of foliage and sand. Against foliage, {UV}-reflecting berries had higher chromatic and achromatic contrasts than black berries, and crows detected them from a larger distance. Against sand, {UV}-reflecting berries had low achromatic contrasts and black berries low chromatic contrasts. Crows detected both fruit types equally, suggesting that they used chromatic contrasts to detect {UV}-reflecting berries and achromatic contrasts to detect black berries. Birds prioritized chromatic contrasts when searching for artificial red fruits in foliage but not when searching for blueberries on sand. We suggest that the relative importance of chromatic and achromatic contrasts is contingent on the chromatic and achromatic variance of the background. Models of signal perception can be improved by incorporating background-specific effects.},

To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the "{BiSSE}" model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from I to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.

	abstract = {Avian eggshell color is remarkably variable among and within species and its possible function has long been controversial. Female birds use biliverdin pigment to color their eggs blue and green. Although evidence is accumulating that blue-green eggshell coloration is costly to produce, the exact mechanisms underlying its expression are little studied. Biliverdin pigment is involved in important maintenance functions such as immune and antioxidant defenses and shows similar properties to carotenoid pigments. Carotenoids play a role as immunoenhancers and have the potential to ameliorate the impact of oxidative processes, although their antioxidant function could be minor for some bird species. Important life-history components can be limited by carotenoid availability, including sexual displays and fecundity. Here we explored if biliverdin-based eggshell pigmentation was affected by carotenoid availability in a seabird, by performing a carotenoid supplementation experiment in female blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii) after laying their first egg. In this species, blue eggshell color is associated with incubation patterns, and carotenoid availability affects the crucial trade-off between female foot ornamentation and fecundity. We found that under natural conditions, there was a decline in eggshell color with laying order, suggesting pigment limitation for females. However, carotenoid-supplemented females had enhanced second egg coloration compared to controls, and the color increase was independent of their previous pigment allocation to the first egg. Our results suggest that biliverdin-based eggshell coloration is costly to produce and can be alleviated by current carotenoid availability.},

This situation presents the opportunity to compare patterns of variation in three associated genomes, Wolbachia and the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of its host. Furthermore, although Nasonia wasps are emerging as a model for evolutionary and genetic studies, little is known about their genetic variability. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms ({AFLPs}), all three species present a relatively high level of nuclear polymorphism and have different patterns of variation, with one of the species, Nasonia giraulti, being divided into two divergent subgroups. In each species, the mitochondrial pattern of variation is different from the nuclear pattern, possibly due to genetic hitchhiking of the mitochondria during (cytoplasmically inherited) Wolbachia sweeps. Mitochondria in Nasonia show a synonymous substitution rate approximately 10-15-fold higher than nuclear genes, probably reflecting an elevated mitochondrial mutation rate that is among the highest found in insects. Finally, all three species are doubly infected with their own strains of Wolbachia, one each from the two major supergroups (A and B). Sequence analysis reveals that each of the three Nasonia species acquired their A and B bacteria independently by horizontal transfer events from other insects with the exception of B type Wolbachia in N. longicornis and N. giraulti, which were acquired prior to speciation and then codiverged with the host. This represents one of the few clear-cut examples of codivergence of Wolbachia during host speciation.},

Methods to study color signals range from human assessment to models of receiver vision, with objective measurements commonly involving spectrometry or digital photography. However, signal assessment by a receiver is not objective but linked to receiver perception. Here, we use standardized digital photographs of female rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) face and hindquarter regions, combined with estimates of the timing of the female fertile phase, to assess how color varies with respect to this timing. We compare objective color measures (camera sensor responses) with models of rhesus vision (retinal receptor stimulation and visual discriminability). Due to differences in spectral separation between camera sensors and rhesus receptors, camera measures overestimated color variation and underestimated luminance variation compared with rhesus macaques. Consequently, objective digital camera measurements can produce statistically significant relationships that are probably undetectable to rhesus macaques, and hence biologically irrelevant, while missing variation in the measure that may be relevant. Discrimination modeling provided results that were most meaningful (as they were directly related to receiver perception) and were easiest to relate to underlying physiology. Further, this gave new insight into the function of such signals, revealing perceptually salient signal luminance changes outside of the fertile phase that could potentially enhance paternity confusion. Our study demonstrates how, even for species with similar visual systems to humans, models of vision may provide more accurate and meaningful information on the form and function of visual signals than objective color measures do.},

While considerable progress has been made in understanding the floral traits involved in sexual deception, less is known about how this remarkable mimicry system might have arisen, the role of pre-adaptations in promoting its evolution and its extent as a pollination mechanism outside the few groups of plants (primarily orchids) where it has been described to date. In the Euro-Mediterranean region, pollination by sexual deception is traditionally considered to be the hallmark of the orchid genus Ophrys. Here, we introduce two new cases outside of Ophrys, in plant groups dominated by generalized, shelter-mimicking species. On the basis of phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral pollination strategies, we provide evidence for independent and bidirectional evolutionary transitions between generalized (shelter mimicry) and specialized (sexual deception) pollination strategies in three groups of flowering plants, and suggest that pseudocopulation has evolved from pre-adaptations (floral colours, shapes and odour bouquets) that selectively attract male pollinators through shelter mimicry. These findings, along with comparative analyses of floral traits (colours and scents), shed light on particular phenotypic changes that might have fuelled the parallel evolution of these extraordinary pollination strategies. Collectively, our results provide the first substantive insights into how pollination sexual deception might have evolved in the Euro-Mediterranean region, and demonstrate that even the most extreme cases of pollinator specialization can reverse to more generalized interactions, breaking ‘Cope's rule of specialization’.},

	abstract = {Theory and empirical evidence indicate that male secondary sex traits can evolve by co-option of pre-existing biases in females. However, relatively few studies have explored whether male pre-existing biases could drive the evolution of traits important in male contests. Male spiny lizards (Sceloporus) are characterized by the expression of sexually dimorphic blue throat and abdominal patches. These features are revealed to conspecifics during social interactions, and variation in ventral color can predict the outcome of male contests in some species of spiny lizards. In Sceloporus minor, males in some populations also express bright blue color on the dorsal surfaces. Given the significance of blue color in intrasexual signaling in other species of Sceloporus, blue dorsal color may have evolved in S. minor by co-option of a male sensory bias for the color blue. We tested this hypothesis in a population that exhibits an ancestral phenotype for male dorsal color (brown/orange), and lacks males with bright blue dorsal coloration. Resident territorial males were presented with one of three types of intruder males manipulated in dorsal color by painting. Orange males mimicked the ancestral dorsal phenotype found at the study site; blue males resembled those from a population with the derived (blue) form of this trait; and green males represented a novel stimulus control. If blue dorsal color evolved in S. minor in part due to co-option of a male sensory bias, we predicted that resident males would exhibit either increased or decreased levels of aggression to blue intruders relative to controls. We found no difference in resident aggressive behavior across all treatments, thus failing to support the predictions of a pre-existing bias. We discuss these findings in the context of social behavior in Sceloporus, and propose directions for further study in this species.},

We tested this prediction in Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae), a sexually dichromatic desert reptile that preys on insects and smaller lizard species, and which in turn is prey for birds and snakes. We modelled the spectral sensitivities of the lizards and their avian and snake predators, and compared the conspicuousness of the lizards' entire colour patterns with each class of viewers. Almost all comparisons involving females strongly supported our prediction for greater chromatic and brightness conspicuousness against local terrestrial visual backgrounds to their own modelled visual system than to those of avian and snake predators. Males, in contrast, exhibited far fewer cases of greater conspicuousness to their own visual system than to those of their predators. Our own perception of spectral similarity between blue C. dickersonae males and a local nonterrestrial visual background (i.e. the Sea of Cortez) prompted a further investigation. We compared sea (and sky) radiance with dorsum radiance of C. dickersonae males and with males from two distantly-related Crotaphytus collaris populations in which males possess blue bodies. In all three visual models, C. dickersonae males exhibited significantly lower chromatic contrast with the sea (and sky) than did their noncoastal, blue-bodied congeners. Among potential explanations, the blue body coloration that is unique to male C. dickersonae may offset, if only slightly, the cost of visibility to predators (and to prey) through reduced contrast against the extensive, local, nonterrestrial blue backgrounds of the sea and sky.

We then illustrate how enhanced sensitivity to insulin/{IGF} signaling in a growing ornament or weapon would cause heightened condition-sensitivity and increased variability in expression among individuals—critical properties of reliable signals of male quality. The possibility that reliable signaling arises as a byproduct of the growth mechanism may explain why trait exaggeration has evolved so many different times in the context of sexual selection.},

The reflectance of the white wing areas of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably higher than that of the white wing areas of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude.

Although research initially concentrated on why these manipulations were observed, more recent study has emphasized the profound effects they may have on the ecology and evolution of their host. We review the natural history and evolutionary ecology of inherited reproductive parasites, before examining their impact on host ecology and evolution. We posit that sex-ratio distorting microorganisms sometimes dominate their host's microevolution and reproductive ecology, driving extremely rapid natural selection, altering the molecular evolution landscape, and potentially causing evolution in conserved systems such as sex determination. The evolutionary importance of symbionts inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility lies more in the barriers to gene flow the v can produce, which may then contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation. Throughout, we link theory with empirical data, point to areas of ignorance, and identify promising avenues of future research.},

Analyses at two taxonomic levels provide a first-order test of the prevalence of {DCWs} by using simple and very conservative operational criteria. For four of the Big Five mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic, the marine genera that survived the extinction suffered approximate to10-20\% attrition in the immediately following geologic stage that was significantly greater than the losses sustained in preextinction stages. The stages immediately following the three Paleozoic mass extinctions also account for 17\% of all order-level losses in marine invertebrates over that interval, which is, again, significantly greater than that seen for the other stratigraphic stages (no orders are lost immediately after the end-Triassic or end-Cretaceous mass extinctions). {DCWs} are not evenly distributed among four regional molluscan time-series following the end-Cretaceous extinction, demonstrating the importance of spatial patterns in recovery dynamics. Although biotic interactions have been invoked to explain the differential postextinction success of clades, such hypotheses must be tested against alternatives that include stochastic processes in low-diversity lineages-which is evidently not a general explanation for the ordinal {DCW} patterns, because postextinction fates are not related to the size of extinction bottlenecks in Paleozoic orders-and ongoing physical environmental changes.},

We approached this question by investigating genetic and morphological variation among populations of the strawberry poison frog, Dendrobates pumilio, in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, Panama. We found significant population genetic structure and isolation by distance based on amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Snout vent length ({SVL}), coloration and the extent and size of dorsal black spots showed large variation among the studied populations. Differences in {SVL} correlated with genetic distance, whereas black spot patterns and other coloration parameters did not. Indeed, the latter characters were observed to be dramatically different between contiguous populations located on the same island. These results imply that neutral divergence among populations may account for the genetic patterns based on amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and {SVL}. However, selective pressures need to be invoked in order to explain the extraordinary variation in spot size and coverage, and coloration. We discuss the possibility that the observed variation in colour morphs is a consequence of a combination of local variation in both natural selection on an aposematic signal towards visual predators and sexual selection generated by colour morph-specific mate preferences.},

One hypothesis for mutual ornamentation is mutual sexual selection, where similar selective pressures shape the ornamental traits in both sexes. We examined multiple melanin-based plumage traits (chestnut-colored breast plumage, tail-spot size and damage) in male and female American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in relation to patterns of mating, individual quality, breeding performance, and incidence of extra-pair paternity. We found positive assortative social mating based on breast color and tail-spot damage. Tail-spot size was unrelated to patterns of social mating, and none of the plumage traits examined was associated with the incidence of extra-pair paternity. Brighter breast plumage and less damage to tail spots were positively associated with several measures of breeding performance in female American Robins. In males, body condition was positively correlated with breast color, but nest defense was actually lower in males with brighter breasts and less tail-spot damage. Although male and female ornamentation in the American Robin may be the product of mutual mate choice, further assessment of this hypothesis requires information on how an individual's parental investment is affected by its own and its mate's plumage and on how plumage varies with age.},

Conclusions: High Wolbachia frequencies were detected in southern populations, but no infection was found in the northern parts of Japan. Cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing Wolbachia was found in the two main types of host (brown and yellow), which are reproductively isolated.

Carotenoid-based ornaments are common sexual signals of birds and often influence mate choice. Skin or beaks pigmented by carotenoids can change colour rapidly, and could be particularly useful as honest indicators of an individual's current condition and/or health. This is because carotenoids must be acquired through diet and/or allocation for ornamental coloration might be to the detriment of self-maintenance needs. Here, we investigated whether the carotenoid-based coloration of eye rings and beak of male red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa predicted condition (mass corrected for size), parasite load (more specifically infection by coccidia, a main avian intestinal parasite) or a greater immune responsiveness (swelling response to a plant lectin, phytohaemagluttinin, or {PHA}). Redness of beak and eye rings positively correlated with plasma carotenoid levels. Also, males in better condition had fewer coccidia, more circulating carotenoids and a greater swelling response to {PHA}. Carotenoid-based ornamentation predicted coccidia abundance and immune responsiveness (redder males had fewer coccidia and greater swelling response to {PHA}), but was only weakly positively related to condition. Thus, the carotenoid pigmentation of beak and eye rings reflected the current health status of individuals. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that allocation trade-offs (carotenoid use for ornamentation versus parasite defence needs) might ensure reliable carotenoid-based signalling.},

	abstract = {Due to cytoplasmic inheritance, spread of maternally inherited Wolbachia symbionts can result in reduction of mitochondrial variation in populations. We examined sequence diversity of the mitochondrial {NADH} dehydrogenase subunit 4 ({ND}4) gene in Wolbachia-infected (South Africa ({SA}), California and Thailand) and uninfected ({SA}) Culex pipiens complex populations. In total, we identified 12 haplotypes (A–L). In infected populations, 99\% of individuals had haplotype K. In the uninfected {SA} population, 11 haplotypes were present, including K. Nuclear allozyme diversity was similar between infected and uninfected {SA} populations. Analysis of nuclear {DNA} sequences suggested that haplotype K presence in uninfected {SA} Cx. pipiens was probably due to a shared ancestral polymorphism rather than hybrid introgression. These data indicate that Wolbachia spread has resulted in drastic reduction of mitochondrial variability in widely separated Cx. pipiens complex populations. In contrast, the uninfected {SA} population is probably a cryptic species where Wolbachia introgression has been prevented by reproductive isolation, maintaining ancestral levels of mitochondrial diversity. Molecular clock analyses suggest that the Wolbachia sweep occurred within the last 47 000 years. The effect of Wolbachia on mitochondrial dynamics can provide insight on the potential for Wolbachia to spread transgenes into mosquito populations to control vector-borne diseases.},

We performed female mate choice experiments, focusing on the {UV} wavelength range, with the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a species in which the role of visually guided behaviour in the human-visible wavelength range (400-700 nm) has been well studied. Ripe female sticklebacks were given the opportunity to watch courting males behind {UV}-transmitting ({UV}+) and {UV}-blocking ({UV}-) optical filters. We tested the hypothesis that a difference in viewing conditions, manipulated by the two optical filters, would affect male attractiveness, as indicated by the time that the female stayed near the males. Females significantly preferred {UV}+ males. They also became less selective with time. Control experiments, in which neutral-density optical filters were used, showed that the ability to perceive {UV} wavelengths is likely to be used for colour discrimination instead of detecting brightness differences.

The accordingly specular green and purple areas have, with normal illumination, 100–150 nm broad reflectance bands, peaking at about 530 and 700 nm. The bands shift progressively towards shorter wavelengths with increasing oblique illumination, and the reflection then becomes highly polarized. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the epicuticle of the green and purple areas consists of stacks of 16 and 12 layers, respectively. Assuming gradient refractive index values of the layers between 1.6 and 1.7 and applying the classical multilayer theory allowed modelling of the measured polarization- and angle-dependent reflectance spectra.

The overreplicating {wMelPop} strain was recently shown to strongly inhibit the replication of dengue virus when introduced into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as well as to stimulate chronic immune up-regulation. Here we show that stable introduction of the {wMel} strain of Drosophila melanogaster into Aedes albopictus, a vector of dengue and other arboviruses, abolished the transmission capacity of dengue virus-challenged mosquitoes. Immune up-regulation was observed in the transinfected line, but at a much lower level than that previously found for transinfected Ae. aegypti. Transient infection experiments suggest that this difference is related to Ae. albopictus immunotolerance of Wolbachia, rather than to the Wolbachia strain used. This study provides an example of strong pathogen inhibition in a naturally Wolbachia-infected mosquito species, demonstrating that this inhibition is not limited to naturally naïve species, and suggests that the Wolbachia strain is more important than host background for viral inhibition. Complete bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility was observed with {WT} strains infected with the naturally occurring Ae. albopictus Wolbachia, and this provides a mechanism for introducing {wMel} into natural populations of this species.},

Conservation strategies increasingly incorporate measures to combat fragmentation such as ecological networks. These are often based on assessment of landscape structure but such approaches fail to capitalise on the potential offered by more ecologically robust assessments of landscape function and connectivity. In this paper, we describe a modelling approach to identifying functional habitat networks and demonstrate its application to a fragmented landscape where policy initiatives seek to improve conditions for woodland biodiversity including increasing woodland cover. Functional habitat networks were defined by identifying suitable habitat and by modelling connectivity using least-cost approaches to account for matrix permeability. Generic focal species ({GFS}) profiles were developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to represent species with high and moderate sensitivity to fragmentation. We demonstrated how this form of analysis can be used to aid the spatial targeting of conservation actions. This 'targeted' action scenario was tested for effectiveness against comparable scenarios, which were based on random and clumped actions within the same landscape. We tested effectiveness using structural metrics, network-based metrics and a published functional connectivity indicator. Targeting actions within networks resulted in the highest mean woodland area and highest connectivity indicator value. Our approach provides an assessment of landscape function by recognising the importance of the landscape matrix. It provides a framework for the targeting and evaluation of alternative conservation options, offering a pragmatic, ecologically-robust solution to a current need in applied landscape ecology.},

I show here that the weights of long prey have sometimes been seriously overestimated by these equations. In addition, the longer prey captured by spiders probably represent highly biased samples, in terms of both low weight/body length and low momentum/body weight, of the longer prey available in the environment, leading to overestimates of the kinetic energy that the orb needed to absorb to stop them. Deductions concerning how selection acts on orb designs that have been based on the prey captured are also flawed, because additional data on prey availabilities and prey escapes are needed to evaluate the possible gains and losses from different orb designs. Still another complication is that data on prey abundances in natural rather than altered environments are needed to understand past selection pressures that produced present-day web forms. I conclude that a dominant importance for rare large prey in orb web evolution has not been conclusively demonstrated to be a general rule for orb weavers. A more inclusive approach regarding orb functions is prudent, especially because many traits that improve some functions have opposite effects on others.

Our present study challenges this assumption, demonstrating that in addition to the requirement of absorbing pigmentation, complex nano-structures contribute to the low reflectance of certain natural surfaces. We describe preliminary findings of an investigation into the nature of the black regions observed on the dorsal wings of several Lepidoptera. Specifically, we quantify the optical absorption associated with black wing regions on the butterfly Papilio ulysses and find that the nano-structure of the wing scales of these regions contributes significantly to their black appearance.},

	abstract = {Because of the continuous focusing of thermal and chemical energy, ancient submarine hot springs are contenders as sites for the origin of life. But it is generally assumed that these would be of the acid and high-temperature 'black smoker' variety (Corliss et al., 1981). In fact today the greater part of the ocean circulates through off-ridge springs where it issues after modification at temperatures of around 40-degrees-C or so but with the potential to reach 200-degrees-C. Such offridge or ridge-flank springs remind us that there are other candidate sites for the origin of life. Although there is no firm indication of the {pH} of these off-ridge springs we have argued that the solutions are likely to be alkaline rather than acid. We test the feasibility of this idea using {EQ} geochemical water-rock interaction modelling codes (Wolery 1983) and find that for a range of possible initial chemistries of Hadean seawater, the {pH} of issuing solutions at around 200-degrees-C is around one or more units alkaline. Such {pH} values hold for interaction with both basaltic and komatiitic crust. The robustness of this result suggests to us that alkaline submarine springs of moderate temperature, carrying many hundreds of ppm {HS}- to the ocean basins, are also serious contenders as sites for the origin of life, particularly as Hadean seawater was probably slightly acid, with a dissolved iron concentration approaching 100 ppm. On mixing of these solutions, supersaturation, especially of iron sulphide, would lead to the precipitation of colloidal gels. In our view iron sulphide was the likely substance of, or contributor to, the first vesicle membranes which led to life, as the supply of organic molecules would have been limited in the Hadean. Such a membrane would have had catalytic properties, expansivity, and would have maintained the natural chemiosmotic gradient, a consequence of the acid ocean and the alkaline interior to the vesicles.},

There are few comparisons of the different methods used to summarize and analyse spectrophotometer data, however. Using colour data on over 900 species of birds, we compared three methods of calculating sexual dichromatism using spectrophotometer data. We also compared sexual dichromatism calculated from spectrophotometer data, in both the ultraviolet ({UV}) and bird-visible range, with human estimates of sexual dichromatism. We found that all three methods, principal component analysis, segment classification and colour discriminability, yielded essentially comparable estimates of dichromatism for our extensive sample of birds. Certain methods may be better suited to a particular study depending on the questions addressed and the specific colours examined. We found that human visual estimates of dichromatism were similar to spectrophotometer estimates of dichromatism in the bird-visible range; however, human visual estimates did not predict the extent of {UV} dichromatism. Therefore, the conclusions of previous studies that relied on human vision to assess sexual dichromatism should be reliable. It is not possible, however, to predict a priori whether a species exhibits {UV} dichromatism without spectrophotometer measurements.},

	abstract = {Melanin-based coloration is widespread among vertebrates, but the adaptive function of this trait remains poorly known. Recently, it has been shown that differently coloured individuals have different abilities to cope with parasites. This correlation between melanin-based coloration and immunity could be explained by the pleiotropic effects of genes coding for melanin pigmentation on the immune system ('genetic link' hypothesis) but also because differently coloured individuals may exploit alternative habitats varying in parasite exposure, which leads to different development of the immune function ('exposure' hypothesis). As feral pigeons Columba livia are genetically polymorphic with respect to melanic coloration, they constitute an ideal model system to address such hypotheses. In this study, we showed that darker melanic individuals had a lower endoparasite intensity (reflecting host susceptibility) and had a greater cellular immune response to {PHA} injection than paler ones, whereas parasite prevalence (reflecting exposure to vectors) was similar between colorations. These results provide a correlative support of the 'genetic link' hypothesis: differently coloured individuals might be similarly exposed to parasites but darker ones might have a better ability to control the infection. This suggests that parasitism could play a crucial role in the maintenance of colour polymorphism in natural populations, which opens the interesting possibility that differently coloured individuals could be adapted to alternative environments varying in parasite diversity and exposure.},

These fights were initially interpreted as wars of attrition based on fat reserves, but the distributions of fat at the end of fights suggests at least some assessment of the opponent's condition. Alternatively, new models have been developed that show how the observed pattern could result without assessment. We show that there is a subtle but reliable cue to fat reserves: colour. Females are a relatively drab brown-black. Males are a strikingly iridescent blue-green colour, resulting from a multilayer constructive interference reflector system in the epicuticle. In fatter males the lamellae are more compressed and the peak reflectance is at shorter wavelengths (blue). Leaner, greener males have greater spacing between lamellae and reflect longer wavelengths. The peak reflectance is as predicted from transmission electron micrograph measurements of the lamellar spacing. The rate of change in spacing over time can be manipulated experimentally by manipulating the diet. Individuals on a higher food diet remained blue longer and at the end of the experiment were fatter and bluer. In our studies, colour is a better predictor of territorial status than fat.

Next, discrimination between the wavelengths was established at equal, suprathreshold, intensities. Finally, the intensities of the two stimuli were reduced to establish the intensity threshold for the wavelength discrimination. The results indicate that goldfish, like several mammalian species, can discriminate wavelength at detection threshold intensity. This finding suggests that high color sensitivity is not confined to mammals or dependent upon a very high percentage of wavelength opponent ganglion cells. Rather, high color vision sensitivity may be based upon an inherent sensitivity advantage of wavelength opponent receptive fields compared to non-wavelength opponent receptive fields and be an important selective advantage of wavelength opponency and color vision.},

	abstract = {The bright colours of nestlings' mouths are conspicuous when they beg. Three main hypotheses suggest that nestling mouth colour (1) increases detectability in dim ambient light, (2) signals health or quality, or (3) provides a means of offspring recognition. To distinguish these hypotheses, we manipulated both the flange colour (visual and {UV} spectrum) and the ambient light in the nest of three cavity-nesting species: a woodpecker and two passerines. Parents avoided nestlings with black-painted flanges to a greater extent in dim than in bright ambient light conditions, and the effect was most pronounced in the woodpecker, which had the deepest and darkest nest cavity of the three species studied. There was no difference in mass gain of nestlings with flanges painted white or yellow or with {UV}-block cream relative to controls, suggesting that neither {UV} reflectance nor carotenoid colour was a cue of nestling quality. These results support the detectability hypothesis and not the health-signalling or recognition function for bright flanges. Black-painted flycatcher nestlings were more disadvantaged in short trials ({\textless}3 h) than in longer trials ({\textgreater}3 h), and we developed a model to explain how nonvisual components of begging, such as vocalizations or movements, may become more important than visual cues as nestlings become hungrier and beg more intensively over time. Our results suggest that bright flanges in cavity-nesting birds evolved primarily so that parents can locate offspring in dim light, but competition among nestlings may lead to exaggerated brightness. Furthermore, other components of begging such as movements or vocalizations may temporarily override a disadvantage of dull mouth colour. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

	abstract = {Conspicuous warning coloration helps to protect prey because it signals to potential predators that the prey is unprofitable. However, such signals only work once predators have come to associate the conspicuous colour with the unprofitability of the prey. The evolution of warning coloration is generally considered to be paradoxical, because it has traditionally been assumed that the first brightly coloured individuals would be at an immediate selective disadvantage because of their greater conspicuousness to predators that are naive to the meaning of the signal. As a result, it has been difficult to understand how a novel conspicuous colour morph could ever avoid rapid extinction, and instead survive and spread in the population until predators have become educated about the signal. In the present study, we experimentally simulated the appearance of a single novel coloured mutant in small populations (20 individuals) of palatable artificial pastry "prey". The colour morph frequencies in each "generation" of prey (presented on successive days of a trial) were determined by the relative survival of the previous generation under predation by free-living birds. We found that the novel colour morphs regularly persisted and increased from a starting frequency of 1/20 to reach fixation (100\%), despite being fully palatable, even when the novel morph was much more conspicuous against the background than the familiar morph. This was true for both green (not normally considered a warning colour) and red (a classic warning colour) novel morphs. Novel colours reached fixation significantly faster than could be accounted for by random drift, indicating differential predation in relation to prey colour by the birds. Our experiments show that the immediate demise of a fully palatable new prey morph is not an inevitable outcome of predator behaviour, because even very conspicuous prey can gain protection from conservative foragers, simply by being novel.},

	abstract = {There are two major competing explanations for the counter-intuitive presence of bright coloration in certain orb-web spiders. Bright coloration could lure insect prey to the web vicinity, increasing the spider's foraging success. Alternatively, the markings could function as disruptive camouflage, making it difficult for the insect prey to distinguish spiders from background colour variation. We measured the prey capture rates of wasp spiders, Argiope bruennichi, that were blacked out, shielded from view using a leaf fragment, or left naturally coloured. Naturally coloured spiders caught over twice the number of prey as did either blacked-out or leaf-shielded spiders, and almost three times as many orthopteran prey. Spectrophotometer measurements suggest that the bright yellow bands on the spider's abdomen are visible to insect prey, but not the banding on the legs, which could disguise the spider's outline. Thus, our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that bright coloration in the wasp spider acts as a visual lure for insect prey and weak support for the hypothesis that the arrangement of the banding pattern across the spider's body disguises the presence of the spider on the web.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims ‘Human-red’ flowers are traditionally considered to be rather unpopular with bees, yet some allogamous species in the section Oncocyclus (genus Iris, Iridaceae) have evolved specialized interactions with their pollinators, a narrow taxonomic range of male solitary bees. The dark-red, tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide protective shelters (i.e. a non-nutritive form of reward) primarily to male solitary bees (Apidae, Eucerini) that pollinate the flowers while looking for a shelter. An earlier study on orchids suggested that species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n-alkenes (unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons). Whether or not this also applies to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown.Methods Using Iris atropurpurea, recording of pollinator preferences for shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of floral colours (by spectrophotometry) and scents (by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) to test the hypotheses that (a) pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun (floral heat-reward hypothesis), and that (b) flowers pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons (n-alkenes) in their floral scent (preadaptation to sexual-deception hypothesis).Key Results Male bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or with the presence of high absolute/relative amounts and numbers of n-alkenes in the floral scent.Conclusions The results suggest that the flowers of I. atropurpurea probably evolved by pollinator-mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to mimic large achromatic (‘bee-black’) protective shelters used preferentially by male solitary bees, and that pollinator visits are presumably not the result of an odour-based sexual stimulation or motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing the rising sun.},

	abstract = {Many microorganisms form symbioses with plants that range, on a continuous scale, from parasitic to mutualistic. Among these, the most widespread mutualistic symbiosis is the arbuscular mycorrhiza, formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal ({AM}) fungi and vascular flowering plants. These associations occur in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world and have a global impact on plant phosphorus nutrition. The arbuscular mycorrhiza is an endosymbiosis in which the fungus inhabits the root cortical cells and obtains carbon provided by the plant while it transfers mineral nutrients from the soil to the cortical cells. Development of the symbiosis involves the differentiation of both symbionts to create novel symbiotic interfaces within the root cells. The aim of this review is to explore the current understanding of the signals and signaling pathways used by the symbionts for the development of the {AM} symbiosis. Although the signal molecules used for initial communication are not yet known, recent studies point to their existence. Within the plant, there is evidence of arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signals and of systemic signaling that influences phosphate-starvation responses and root development. The landmark cloning of three plant signaling proteins required for the development of the symbiosis has provided the first insights into a signaling pathway that is used by {AM} fungi and by rhizobia for their symbiotic associations with legumes.

All diapause pupae of B. alcinous observed in the field during winter showed pupal coloration of a dark-brown type. When larvae were reared and allowed to reach pupation under short-day conditions at 18 degrees C under a 60 +/- 5\% relative humidity, diapause pupae exhibited pupal color types of brown (33\%), light-brown (25\%), yellowish-brown (21\%), diapause light-yellow (14\%) and diapause yellow (7\%). When mature larvae reared at 18 degrees C were transferred and allowed to reach pupation at 10 degrees C and 25 degrees C under a 60 +/- 5\% relative humidity after a gut purge, the developmental ratio of brown and light-brown, yellowish-brown, and diapause light-yellow and diapause yellow types was 91.2, 8.8 and 0.0\% at 10 degrees C, and 12.2, 48.8 and 39.0\% at 25 degrees C, respectively. On the other hand, when mature larvae reared at 18 degrees C were transferred and allowed to reach pupation at 10 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C under an over 90\% relative humidity after a gut purge, the developmental ratio of brown and light-brown, yellowish-brown, and diapause light-yellow and diapause yellow types was 79.8, 16.9 and 3.3\% at 10 degrees C, 14.5, 26.9 and 58.6\% at 18 degrees C, and 8.3, 21.2 and 70.5\% at 25 degrees C, respectively. These results indicate that diapause pupae of brown types are induced by lower temperature and humidity conditions, whereas yellow types are induced by higher temperature and humidity conditions. The findings of this study show that diapause pupae of B. alcinous exhibit pupal color diphenism comprising brown and diapause yellow types, and suggest that temperature and humidity experienced after a gut purge are the main factors that affect the diapause pupal coloration of B. alcinous as environmental cues.

One hypothesis on the function of this pigmentation proposes that blue-green egg chroma signals female quality and that males respond to this signal by increased provisioning to presumably higher-quality Clutches. The hypothesized mechanism is that blue-green egg color signals female antioxidant capacity, because the eggshell pigment responsible for blue-green coloration, biliverdin, has antioxidant properties in the mother. Our study is the first to examine this mechanism, which is critical to this hypothesis. We found that female Gray Catbirds with higher total antioxidant capacity laid eggs with higher blue-green chroma. In addition, we found that males provided more care to nestlings from Clutches with higher average blue-green egg chroma. This shows,in intriguing potential link between female antioxidant capacity and blue-green egg chroma. Interpreting the variation in females' antioxidant capacity will require a better understanding of the relative importance of dietary intake of antioxidants, oxidative stress, and the cost of depositing biliverdin into eggs.},

W. pipientis was originally discovered in cells of the mosquito Culex pipiens and is the only formally described member of the genus. Molecular sequence-based studies have revealed a number of phylogenetically diverse strains of W. pipientis. Owing to uncertainty about whether W. pipientis comprises more than one species, researchers in the field now commonly refer to W. pipientis simply as Wolbachia. In this note, we briefly review higher-level phylogenetic and recombination studies of W. pipientis and propose that all the intracellular symbionts known to cluster closely with the type strain of W. pipientis, including those in the currently recognized supergroups (A–H), are officially given this name.},

Specific attraction of the targeted pollinator is achieved by sex pheromone mimicry, which constitutes the major attraction channel. In close vicinity of the flower, visual signals may enhance attraction, as was shown recently in the sexually deceptive orchid Ophrys heldreichii. Here, we conducted an in situ manipulation experiment in two populations of O. heldreichii on Crete to investigate whether the presence/absence of the conspicuous pink perianth affects reproductive success in two natural orchid populations. We estimated reproductive success of three treatment groups (with intact, removed and artificial perianth) throughout the flowering period as pollinaria removal (male reproductive success) and massulae deposition (female reproductive success). Reproductive success was significantly increased by the presence of a strong visual signal-the conspicuous perianth-in one study population, however, not in the second, most likely due to the low pollinator abundance in the latter population. This study provides further evidence that the coloured perianth in O. heldreichii is adaptive and thus adds to the olfactory signal to maximise pollinator attraction and reproductive success.},

The timing and context of the shift suggested that diesters could provide a visible quality signal during mate choice. We used captive red knots Calidris canutus to test whether mono- and diester preen waxes affect the light reflectance ("colour") to the plumage. We also determined light absorbance spectra of the two wax types. The reflectance of breast feathers of the breeding plumage was measured with spectrophotometry when birds secreted monoesters and six weeks later when they secreted diester preen waxes. Light reflectance was also measured after removing the mono- and diester waxes from the plumage with a solvent. The results show that: (1) diester preen waxes absorb more light, especially ultraviolet ({UV}) , than monoester preen waxes, but that (2) the compositional shift in the preen waxes did not change plumage reflectance and, (3) the removal of preen waxes did not change the reflectance of the plumage within the light spectrum assumed visible to birds (320-700 nm). This is not consistent with the idea that compositional shifts in the preen waxes of red knots have a visual function.},

These processes are influenced by the size and geographical complexity of regions, conditions of the environment, and attributes of individuals and species. Diversity within clades also depends on age and thus the time available for accumulating species. Estimating rates of diversification is key to understanding how these factors have shaped patterns of species richness. Several approaches to calculating both relative and absolute rates of speciation and extinction within clades are based on phylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary relationships. As the size and quality of phylogenies increases, these approaches will find broader application. However, phylogeny reconstruction fosters a perceptual bias of continual increase in species richness, and the analysis of primarily large clades produces a data selection bias. Recognizing these biases will encourage the development of more realistic models of diversification and the regulation of species richness.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are widespread among insects and in many cases cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Such findings have been used to argue that Wolbachia have played an important role in insect speciation. Theoretical models, however, indicate that Wolbachia alone are unlikely to lead to stable reproductive isolation between two formerly conspecific populations. Here we analyze the components of reproductive isolation between Drosophila recens, which is infected with Wolbachia, and its uninfected sister species Drosophila subquinaria. Laboratory pairings demonstrated that gene flow via matings between D. recens females and D. subquinaria males is hindered by behavioral isolation. Matings readily occurred in the reciprocal cross (D. quinaria females x D. recens males), but very few viable progeny were produced. The production of viable hybrids via this route was restored by antibiotic curing of D. recens of their Wolbachia symbionts, indicating that hybrid offspring production is greatly reduced by cytoplasmic incompatibility in the crosses involving infected D. recens males. Thus, behavioral isolation and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility act as complementary asymmetrical isolating mechanisms between these two species. In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybrid females were fertile, whereas hybrid males invariably were sterile. Levels of {mtDNA} variation in D. recens are much lower than in either D. subquinaria or D. falleni, neither of which is infected with Wolbachia. The low haplotype diversity in D. recens is likely due to an {mtDNA} sweep associated with the spread of Wolbachia. Nevertheless, the existence of several {mtDNA} haplotypes in this species indicates that Wolbachia have been present as a potential isolating mechanism for a substantial period of evolutionary time. Finally, we argue that although Wolbachia by themselves are unlikely to bring about speciation, they can increase the rate of speciation in insects.},

We have demonstrated that the insect is infected with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. Several gene fragments of the endosymbiont were sequenced and subsequently used for phylogenetic analysis, revealing that it belongs to the Wolbachia supergroup B. The endosymbiont was visualized within the ovarioles using immunolocalization. Tetracycline treatments were used to cure M. pygmaeus from its infection. Although a completely cured line could not be obtained by this approach, the application of a constant antibiotic pressure over 13 generations resulted in a line with a significantly reduced Wolbachia concentration. Crosses performed with this tetracycline-treated line revealed that the endosymbiont causes severe cytoplasmic incompatibility. This is the first report of a reproductive effect induced by Wolbachia in an economically important heteropteran predator that may have vital implications for its commercial production and use in biological control.

	abstract = {Reproductive incompatibilities called cytoplasmic incompatibilities are known to affect a large number of arthropod species and are mediated by Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted microorganism. The crossing relationships between strains of potential hosts define their incompatibility types and it is generally assumed that differences between strains of Wolbachia induce different crossing types. Among all the described host species, the mosquito, Culex pipiens, displays the greatest variability of cytoplasmic incompatibility crossing types. We analysed mitochondrial and bacterial {DNA} variability in Culex pipiens in order to investigate some possible causes of incompatibility crossing type variability. We sequenced fragments of the {ftsZ} gene, and the A+T–rich control region of the {mtDNA}. We also sequenced the second subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase ({COII}) gene, in Culex pipiens and a closely related species, C. torrentium, in order to verify the usefulness of the A+T–rich region for the present purposes. No variability was found in the Wolbachia {ftsZ} gene fragment, and very limited variation of the mitochondrial marker whatever the compatibility type or the origin of the host. A low variability was found in the A+T–rich region and comparison of divergence of the A+T–rich region and {COII} gene between C. pipiens and C. torrentium did not reveal any special constraints affecting this region. In contrast to observations in other host species, variability of incompatibility crossing types is not due to multiple infections by distantly related Wolbachia strains.},

	abstract = {While decorations of many spiders are made entirely of silk, those built by many Cyclosa species are composed of prey carcasses. The functions of prey carcass decorations are unknown. By manipulating their presence on webs of Cyclosa confusa, we tested whether they attract prey. Insect interception rates of webs with the decoration removed were significantly higher than those of webs with the decoration present. By monitoring predators' responses to spiders with and without decorations on their webs, we also tested whether prey carcass decorations decreased spiders' mortality. Spiders on undecorated webs experienced fewer attacks from paper wasps, Vespa affinis, but these attacks were all directed against the spiders. Although spiders with decorated webs experienced more attacks, wasps usually attacked the decorations rather than the spiders. Finally, we examined how visual signals of prey carcass decorations were perceived by predators. The chromatic colour contrast of the decoration against C. confusa was such that hymenopteran predators could not distinguish the chromatic signals of decorations from those of spiders. We conclude that prey carcass decorations do not attract insects, but may redirect the attack of V affinis, and thus enhance the survival of spiders.

We used a reflectance spectrophotometer to measure feather color in five species of passerines for which museum specimens were collected consistently over the past 100 years. We found that the feather colors of museum specimens collected within the past 50 years were related closely to the feather colors of live birds. In fact, over a wide range of different colors, we found little change in color measurements for recent ({\textless}50 years old) specimens. Furthermore, {UV} color was not affected more severely by fading than human-visible colors when we confined our analyses to recent specimens. These results provide strong support for the continued use of museum specimens to examine coloration in birds, provided that the specimens were collected relatively recently.

	abstract = {Earth has experienced five major extinction events in the past 450 million years. Many scientists suggest we are now witnessing a sixth, driven by human impacts. However, it has been difficult to quantify the real extent of the current extinction episode, either for a given taxonomic group at the continental scale or for the worldwide biota, largely because comparisons of pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic biodiversity baselines have been unavailable. Here, we compute those baselines for mammals of temperate North America, using a sampling-standardized rich fossil record to reconstruct species-area relationships for a series of time slices ranging from 30 million to 500 years ago. We show that shortly after humans first arrived in North America, mammalian diversity dropped to become at least 15\%-42\% too low compared to the "normal" diversity baseline that had existed for millions of years. While the Holocene reduction in North American mammal diversity has long been recognized qualitatively, our results provide a quantitative measure that clarifies how significant the diversity reduction actually was. If mass extinctions are defined as loss of at least 75\% of species on a global scale, our data suggest that North American mammals had already progressed one-fifth to more than halfway (depending on biogeographic province) towards that benchmark, even before industrialized society began to affect them. Data currently are not available to make similar quantitative estimates for other continents, but qualitative declines in Holocene mammal diversity are also widely recognized in South America, Eurasia, and Australia. Extending our methodology to mammals in these areas, as well as to other taxa where possible, would provide a reasonable way to assess the magnitude of global extinction, the biodiversity impact of extinctions of currently threatened species, and the efficacy of conservation efforts into the future.},

	abstract = {Trophic interactions involving plants and animals in tropical mangrove forests have important controlling influences on several population, community and ecosystem-level processes. Insect herbivores remove up to 35\% of leaf area from some mangrove tree species and can cause the death of seedlings. Leaf chemistry and toughness and soil nutrient status all appear to be important in explaining the between- and among-species variance in leaf damage. Insects also attack and damage, mainly by boring, a large proportion of mangrove seeds. Shadehouse experiments have shown that such post-dispersal predation can have a significant effect on seedling survival, growth and biomass allocation to leaves, stems and roots. Sesarmid crabs are also responsible for severe post-dispersal seed predation. In field trials, crabs consumed more than 70\% of the seeds of five tree species. For four of these five species there was an inverse relationship between seed predation rate and the dominance of conspecific adult trees, while the within-site distribution pattern of one tree species appears to be partially controlled by crabs. The same crab species also consume 30-80\% (depending on forest type and intertidal elevation) of the annual litter fall in mangrove forests and, thus, have an important role in controlling the rate of remineralization of detritus within forests and the export of particulate matter from the forests to other nearshore habitats. The other major component of litter in the forests is wood, which is broken down relatively rapidly by teredinid molluscs (shipworms). More than 90\% of the weight loss from decomposing trunks of Rhizophora species during the first four years of decay is through ingestion by teredinids. The annual turnover of dead wood mass in Rhizophora forests is equivalent to that of the processing of leaf detritus by crabs. Because of the relatively low species richness of trees and consumers in tropical mangrove forests, they are likely to serve as productive sites for further investigations of the influence of plant-animal interactions on the dynamics of tropical forests.},

Furthermore, we examined how two species of native bees responded to variation in colour contrast generated by spiders sitting in flowers compared with vacant flowers. We used data from a bee choice experiment with D. evanida spiders and Trigona carbonaria bees and also published data on T. spectabilis spiders and Austroplebeia australis bees. 3. In the field both spider species were always achromatically (from a distance) undetectable but chromatically (at closer range) detectable for bees. Experimentally, we showed species-specific differences in bee behaviour towards particular spider colour variation: T. carbonaria bees did not show any preference for any colour contrasts generated by D. evanida spiders but A. australis bees were more likely to reject flowers with more contrasting T. spectabilis spiders. 4. Our study suggests that some of the spider colour variation that we encounter in the field may be partly explained by the spider's ability to adjust the reflectance properties of its colour relative to the behaviour of the species of prey available.},

	abstract = {Bumblebee colour patterns can be highly variable within species, but are often closely similar among species. The present study takes a quantitative approach to survey bumblebee colour patterns in order to address some of the most basic questions concerning resemblances: (1) do colour-pattern groups exist; (2) are species within colour-pattern groups geographically clumped; and (3) are some colour-pattern groups associated with particular kinds of habitat? The results using data for 632 worker patterns from all of the world's bumblebee species show that: (1) there are many repeating colour patterns, forming relatively few groups of species with similar patterns; (2) colour-pattern groups can be recognized using simple rules; and (3) species within the 24 largest colour-pattern groups are significantly aggregated in particular areas of the world. Three principal divisions of colour-pattern groups are associated with three likely functions: (1) the darkest bumblebees are associated primarily with the tropics, where a thermoregulatory function is suggested; (2) the palest bumblebees are associated with intermediate northern latitudes, where a cryptic function in drying grasslands is suggested; and (3) the intermediate, strongly banded bumblebees are widespread, although these patterns predominate where banding may have advantages as collective warning signals to predators (Mullerian mimicry). Further studies are needed to test these explanations. (C) The Natural History Museum, London. Journal compilation (C) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Recent accumulation of microbial genome data has demonstrated that lateral gene transfers constitute an important and universal evolutionary process in prokaryotes, while those in multicellular eukaryotes are still regarded as unusual, except for endosymbiotic gene transfers from mitochondria and plastids. Here we thoroughly investigated the bacterial genes derived from a Wolbachia endosymbiont on the nuclear genome of the beetle Callosobruchus chinensis. Exhaustive {PCR} detection and Southern blot analysis suggested that similar to 30\% of Wolbachia genes, in terms of the gene repertoire of {wMel}, are present on the insect nuclear genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization located the transferred genes on the proximal region of the basal short arm of the X chromosome. Molecular evolutionary and other lines of evidence indicated that the transferred genes are probably derived from a single lateral transfer event. The transferred genes were, for the length examined, structurally disrupted, freed from functional constraints, and transcriptionally inactive. Hence, most, if not all, of the transferred genes have been pseudogenized. Notwithstanding this, the transferred genes were ubiquitously detected from Japanese and Taiwanese populations of C. chinensis, while the number of the transferred genes detected differed between the populations. The transferred genes were not detected from congenic beetle species, indicating that the transfer event occurred after speciation of C. chinensis, which was estimated to be one or several million years ago. These features of the laterally transferred endosymbiont genes are compared with the evolutionary patterns of mitochondrial and plastid genome fragments acquired by nuclear genomes through recent endosymbiotic gene transfers.},

The general coloration of this species is dark blue-violet, with a white-blue and red crown. Plumage reflectance of seven body regions from 33 study skins belonging to adults of both sexes was measured. Reflectance values were used in a principal components analysis ({PCA}) and hue, short-wave chroma, and {UV} chroma were also measured directly on the spectra. Both {PCA} factor scores and these latter variables were subjected to two-way {ANCOVAs} with sex and season as main factors and the year of capture as a covariate. We found that crowns of males were significantly brighter than those of females. In addition, the nape, chest, and belly showed significant differences in spectral shape, with relatively greater short-wave reflectance and less long-wave reflectance in males than in females. Although sexes were alike in hue, they differed in chroma in almost all body regions. Brightness also differed between seasons, and contrary to our expectation nonbreeding birds were brighter than breeding ones. This result may be a consequence of the particular molt program of tanagers that includes only a complete post-reproductive molt. Despite finding seasonal differences in spectral shape in various body regions, no significant changes in hue, short-wave chroma, or {UV} chroma were evident. To our knowledge, this is the first report of variation in adult plumage color for the Diademed Tanager, and we suggest that dichromatism in tanagers may be even more pervasive than is currently recognized.},

Coloration strategies in peacock feathers are very ingenious and simple: controlling the lattice constant and the number of periods in the photonic-crystal structure. Varying the lattice constant produces diversified colors. The reduction of the number of periods brings additional colors, causing mixed coloration.},

In short, most {DNA} sequence variation can be detected with relatively little sequencing. {SSCP} has been widely applied in medical diagnosis, yet few studies have been published in population genetics. The utility and convenience of {SSCP} is far from fully appreciated by molecular population biologists. We hope to help redress this by illustrating the application of a single simple {SSCP} protocol to mitochondrial genes, nuclear introns, microsatellites, and anonymous nuclear sequences, in a range of vertebrates and invertebrates.

	abstract = {In many species of passerine birds yearlings display a less elaborate version of the adult secondary sexual traits, but the causes of such differences in ornamentation are not always well understood. We studied age-related changes in blue tit Parus caeruleus {UV}/blue structural crown coloration, a sexually selected trait. In our Austrian study population, older blue tits, irrespective of sex, displayed on average a more ultraviolet (lower hue, higher {UV} chroma), more chromatic and brighter crown coloration than yearlings. This age dichromatism was caused by within-individual changes in the expression of crown coloration between years since males and females became more {UV}, more chromatic and brighter as they aged. Colour biased survival did not contribute to the observed pattern of age dichromatism since crown coloration was largely unrelated to overwinter survival. Between-year repeatability of crown colour was significant for most colour variables but low in general, and lower for females than for males. In the blue tit, yearling males might benefit from being less ornamented by avoiding adult aggression but at the expense of sexual attractiveness. Adaptive explanations of blue tit age dichromatism should however take into account that age effects were of similar magnitude in males and females. This suggests that both male and female yearlings could benefit from being less ornamented and hence that sexual selection might be acting on both sexes simultaneously in this species.},

	abstract = {For species in which females mate outside of the pair bond, selection should favor male mate-guarding behaviors that minimize investment in genetically unrelated offspring. Mate guarding may impose costs by diverting time and energy from activities such as foraging and seeking extra-pair copulations, so males should adjust their mate-guarding behavior according to the risk of cuckoldry. In this study, we investigated cuckoldry and mate guarding in the blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea L., 1758), a socially monogamous, territorial songbird. Fifty-three percent of nestlings were extra-pair, and 70\% of nests had at least one extra-pair fertilization. Males with dull Plumage coloration were more likely to be cuckolded than males with more brightly colored Plumage, but duller males did not guard their mates more. Instead. males appeared to adjust mate-guarding behavior according to the attractiveness of neighbors. Males with more brightly colored neighbors guarded their mates more intensely than males with fewer colorful neighbors. These observations suggest that in the blue grosbeak. mate guarding is a context-dependent strategy that is adjusted according to the density and ornamentation of neighboring males.},

	abstract = {The highly reflecting structures found in the integuments and eyes of fish and cephalopods were studied. In all cases they consist of alternate layers of high and low refractive index (n) material (in fish, guanine and cytoplasm) and the high refractive index material is in the form of discrete plates. The highest reflectivity at a given wavelength [{IMG}]f1.gif" {ALT}="Formula" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater}, together with the widest waveband of high reflectivity, would be given if these alternate layers all had an optical thickness of [{IMG}]f2.gif" {ALT}="Formula" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater}. We have examined the possibility that fish and cephalopods can make 'ideal' reflectors of this kind. The thicknesses (t) of the discrete plates released by scratching the reflecting layers were measured by interference microscopy, and it was found that although the plates from a region of a given colour sometimes varied greatly in surface area, their thicknesses were approximately constant. With one exception the optical thicknesses (nt) of the plates found in all the structures studied were between 100 and 200 nm. Many of the reflecting structures are highly coloured and in these there was almost always a good correlation between the wavebands best reflected and four times the optical thicknesses of the plates which they contained. The most ventral scales in the juvenile sprat were studied in some detail. At normal incidence these scales reflect best a waveband around 720 nm and the guanine crystals which they contain all have optical thicknesses close to one quarter of this wavelength. The changes in colour with angle of viewing, and with changes in osmotic concentration of the medium in which these scales are placed, support the idea that the spaces between the crystals are [{IMG}]f2.gif" {ALT}="Formula" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater} spaces. These scales have a high reflectivity to the lights penetrating best into the sea at the oblique angles of incidence from which the strongest intensities of daylight fall in life. Qualitative observations on scales from herring and from other regions on the sprat supported the hypothesis that their guanine crystals were also arranged approximately in [{IMG}]f2.gif" {ALT}="Formula" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater} stacks. Similar conclusions were reached for coloured surfaces found in the skin of the horse mackerel, the iris of the neon tetra, the reflecting tapeta of the dogfish and the spurdog, and in the eye of the squid, Loligo forbesi. In the scales of the roach, Rutilus rutilus, the crystals are of thicknesses which indicate that if in 'ideal' [{IMG}]f2.gif" {ALT}="Formula" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater} stacks they would at normal incidence appear red and at oblique incidence green, whilst in fact they are very little coloured. The crystals from the eyes of Callionymus lyra had 4nt around 300 nm (in the u.v.) yet the reflexions given by piles of these crystals were bronze coloured. Possible explanations of these facts are given.

The interplay between visual and olfactory cues in social as well as in solitary bee species is poorly understood. 2. In this study we tested the host finding and recognition behaviour in a specialized (oligolectic) bee species, Hoplitis adunca (Megachilidae), which collects pollen exclusively on flowers of Echium (Boraginaceae) species. We determined the importance of visual (especially floral colour) and olfactory cues of Echium vulgare flowers in host-plant finding and recognition, as well as in the discrimination of non-host plants (Anchusa officinalis), by foraging-naive and -experienced H. adunca females. 3. Our investigations showed that the interplay between visual and olfactory cues of E. vulgare flowers is essential for host-plant finding and recognition by H. adunca females. The finding suggests that the blue colour of the flowers attracts the bees, while the olfactory cues, which are Echium-specific, are used by the bees to recognize their host plant and discriminate it from non-host plants. 4. Our results show that different modalities of floral cues need to be studied in a combined approach in order to understand the communication in bee-flower interactions and the cues used by bees to find and recognize their host-plants.},

Most Wolbachia spread when their infection frequency exceeds a threshold normally calculated using purely population genetic models. However, spread may also depend on the population dynamics of the insect host. We develop models to explore interactions between host population dynamics and Wolbachia infection frequency for an age-structured insect population regulated by larval density dependence. We first derive a new expression for the threshold frequency that extends existing theory to incorporate important details of the insect's life history. In the presence of immigration and emigration, the threshold also depends on the form of density-dependent regulation. We show how the type of immigration (constant or pulsed) and the temporal dynamics of the host population can strongly affect the spread of Wolbachia. The results help understand the natural dynamics of Wolbachia infections and aid the design of programs to introduce Wolbachia to control insects that are disease vectors or pests.},

Unless butterfly eyes have adaptations for discriminating mimetic color variation, mimicry also carries a risk of confusion for the butterflies themselves. Heliconius butterfly eyes, which express recently duplicated ultraviolet ({UV}) opsins, have such an adaptation. To examine bird and butterfly color vision as sources of selection on butterfly coloration, we studied yellow wing pigmentation in the tribe Heliconiini. We confirmed, using reflectance and mass spectrometry, that only Heliconius use 3-hydroxy-{DL}-kynurenine (3-{OHK}), which looks yellow to humans but reflects both {UV}- and long-wavelength light, whereas butterflies in related genera have chemically unknown yellow pigments mostly lacking {UV} reflectance. Modeling of these color signals reveals that the two {UV} photoreceptors of Heliconius are better suited to separating 3-{OHK} from non-3-{OHK} spectra compared with the photoreceptors of related genera or birds. The co-occurrence of potentially enhanced {UV} vision and a {UV}-reflecting yellow wing pigment could allow unpalatable Heliconius private intraspecific communication in the presence of mimics. Our results are the best available evidence for the correlated evolution of a color signal and color vision. They also suggest that predator visual systems are error prone in the context of mimicry.},

However, the evolution of multicomponent sexual signals remains poorly understood, and past research on this type of signaling has been largely theoretical. Satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, are polygynous, are sexually dichromatic, and construct sexually selected display structures (bowers): a model system for investigating the evolution and signal function of multiple sexual signals. We studied the interrelationship between bower features, plumage coloration, and indicators of male quality in this species. To do this, we located the bowers of male satin bowerbirds in rainforest in Queensland, Australia, and quantified bower quality. We captured the male bower owners and used reflectance spectrometry to objectively measure the plumage coloration of several body regions. We measured various indicators of male health and condition, including the intensity of infection from ectoparasites and blood parasites. Bower quality and male ultraviolet plumage coloration were significantly correlated. By using multiple regression analyses, we show that bower quality predicts ectoparasite load and body size, whereas ultraviolet plumage coloration predicts the intensity of infection from blood parasites, feather growth rate, and body size. Our findings support the multiple messages hypothesis of multicomponent signals: Female satin bowerbirds should assess both male and bower features to choose the highest quality mates.},

	abstract = {Background: Horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}), a source of genetic variation, is generally considered to facilitate hosts' adaptability to environments. However, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of the transferred genes to the evolution of metazoan recipients is rare. Results: In this study, based on sequence data accumulated to date, we used a unified method consisting of similarity search and phylogenetic analysis to detect horizontally transferred genes ({HTGs}) between prokaryotes and five insect species including Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera. Unexpectedly, the candidate {HTGs} were not detected in D. melanogaster, An. gambiae and T. castaneum, and 79 genes in Ap. mellifera sieved by the same method were considered as contamination based on other information. Consequently, 14 types of 22 {HTGs} were detected only in the silkworm. Additionally, 13 types of the detected silkworm {HTGs} share homologous sequences in species of other Lepidopteran superfamilies, suggesting that the majority of these {HTGs} were derived from ancient transfer events before the radiation of Ditrysia clade. On the basis of phylogenetic topologies and {BLAST} search results, donor bacteria of these genes were inferred, respectively. At least half of the predicted donor organisms may be entomopathogenic bacteria. The predicted biochemical functions of these genes include four categories: glycosyl hydrolase family, oxidoreductase family, amino acid metabolism, and others. Conclusions: The products of {HTGs} detected in this study may take part in comprehensive physiological metabolism. These genes potentially contributed to functional innovation and adaptability of Lepidopteran hosts in their ancient lineages associated with the diversification of angiosperms. Importantly, our results imply that pathogens may be advantageous to the subsistence and prosperity of hosts through effective {HGT} events at a large evolutionary scale.},

	abstract = {To improve foraging success or to enhance survival, animals may give out false signals to mislead prey or predators. Web decorations are purported to be structures that some orb-weaving spiders build to transmit deceptive signals to their advantage. Cyclosa ginnaga incorporates a variety of silk (silk decorations) and plant materials (plant detritus decorations) into its webs as decorations. It has been hypothesized that web decorations are deceptive signals that either attract prey, provide protection through camouflage or act as a warning signal. Nevertheless, despite numerous studies on web decorations, their function has remained elusive because of conflicting results. Using a combination of field video recording and the quanti. cation of colour contrasts in the visual systems of hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predators, we tested two functional hypotheses (prey attraction and predator defence) of two forms of web decorations (silk spiral and plant detritus) built by C. ginnaga. Silk-decorated, and to a lesser extent plant-decorated, webs intercepted more prey than undecorated webs, thus improving foraging success. This supports the prey attraction hypothesis; however, we could not rule out the predator defence hypothesis because there was no predation on spiders observed for any web with or without decorations.

	abstract = {Systematic sex-related differences in size and plumage are informative of sex-specific selection pressures. Here, we present an analysis of sexual dimorphism in body size and plumage of Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa limosa from a breeding population in The Netherlands. Molecular methods were used to unambiguously assign the sex of captured birds. To quantify breeding plumage, we developed nine plumage scores. These scores describe the intensity of orange in the breast plumage, the extent of black bars on the belly, the coverage and number of breeding feathers on the back, the conspicuousness of the white eye stripe, the extent of white plumage on the head, the percentage of orange colour in the bill and the percentage of white and black spots covering the neck. Most females were structurally bigger, and had a greater body mass. Nonetheless, we found a greater overlap in bill length between the sexes than expected on the basis of literature data: biometrics alone are not sufficient to correctly discriminate between the sexes. Black-tailed Godwits are sexually dimorphic mostly with respect to the amount of white spots on the neck, females being of lighter colour than males. In addition, females showed fewer black bars and less orange on the breast, had more white in the head and fewer and a smaller extent of breeding feathers on the back. Interestingly, we found a genotypic polymorphism on the sex-related {CHD}1 gene on the Z chromosome, commonly used for molecular sexing in birds. Males of the less frequent genotype had significantly more white in their plumage and had fewer black bars on their breast, while in females no differences between the 6 two genotypes were found.},

Although there are no effective vaccines and efficacious drugs against this parasite, vector reduction methods have been successful in curbing the disease, especially for nagana. Potential vector control methods that do not involve use of chemicals is a genetic modification approach where flies engineered to be parasite resistant are allowed to replace their susceptible natural counterparts, and Sterile Insect technique ({SIT}) where males sterilized by chemical means are released to suppress female fecundity. The success of genetic modification approaches requires identification of strong drive systems to spread the desirable traits and the efficacy of {SIT} can be enhanced by identification of natural mating incompatibility. One such drive mechanism results from the cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) phenomenon induced by the symbiont Wolbachia. {CI} can also be used to induce natural mating incompatibility between release males and natural populations. Although Wolbachia infections have been reported in tsetse, it has been a challenge to understand their functional biology as attempts to cure tsetse of Wolbachia infections by antibiotic treatment damages the obligate mutualistic symbiont (Wigglesworthia), without which the flies are sterile. Here, we developed aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) and fertile tsetse lines by dietary provisioning of tetracycline supplemented blood meals with yeast extract, which rescues Wigglesworthia-induced sterility. Our results reveal that Wolbachia infections confer strong {CI} during embryogenesis in Wolbachia-free (Gmm(Apo)) females when mated with Wolbachia-infected (Gmm(Wt)) males. These results are the first demonstration of the biological significance of Wolbachia infections in tsetse. Furthermore, when incorporated into a mathematical model, our results confirm that Wolbachia can be used successfully as a gene driver. This lays the foundation for new disease control methods including a population replacement approach with parasite resistant flies. Alternatively, the availability of males that are reproductively incompatible with natural populations can enhance the efficacy of the ongoing sterile insect technique ({SIT}) applications by eliminating the need for chemical irradiation.},

	abstract = {Avian plumage colours are model traits in understanding the evolution of sexually selected ornamental traits. Paradoxically, iridescent structural colours, probably the most dazzling of these traits, remain the most poorly understood. Though some data suggest that expression of bright iridescent plumage colours produced by highly ordered arrays of melanosomes and keratin is condition-dependent, almost nothing is known of their ontogeny and thus of any developmental mechanisms that may be susceptible to perturbation. Here, we use light and electron microscopy to compare the ontogeny of iridescent male and non-iridescent female feathers in blue-black grassquits. Feather barbules of males contain a single layer of melanosomes bounded by a thin layer of keratin-producing blue iridescent colour, while those of females contain disorganized melanosomes and no outer layer. We found that nanostructural organization of male barbules occurs late in development, following death of the barbule cell, and is thus unlikely to be under direct cellular control, contrary to previous suggestions. Rather, organization appears to be caused by entropically driven self-assembly through depletion attraction forces that pin melanosomes to the edge of barbule cells and to one another. These forces are probably stronger in developing barbules of males than of females because their melanosomes are (i) larger, (ii) more densely packed, and (iii) more homogeneously distributed owing to the more consistent shape of barbules during keratinization. These data provide the first proposed developmental pathway for iridescent plumage colours, and suggest that any condition dependence of iridescent barbules is likely driven by factors other than direct metabolic cost.},

A growing array of techniques permits quantitative error estimates on some of these potential biases, and allows calculation of species extinction intensities from genus-level data, which are more robust. Extensive as today's species losses probably are, they have yet to equal any of the Big Five mass extinctions. Background extinction patterns are potential sources of insight regarding present-day biotic losses; over 90\% of past species extinction has occurred at times other than the Big Five mass extinctions. Mean durations of fossil species vary by more than an order of magnitude even within clades, rendering uninformative any global average for background extinction. Taxon-specific variation is evidently related to intrinsic biotic factors such as geographic range and population size. Approaches to extinction analysis and prediction based on morphological variety or biodisparity should be explored as an adjunct or alternative to taxon inventories or phylogenetic metrics. Rebounds from mass extinctions are geologically rapid but ecologically slow; biodiversity recovery and the re-establishment of some communities typically requires 5-10 million years.},

Herein the data relating this enzyme is reviewed and discussed from the perspective of the nature of the last detectable common ancestor and the origin of life. The sequence of the gene encoding reverse gyrase from an archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, suggests that this enzyme contains both a helicase and a topoisomerase domains (Confalonieri et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1993, 90, 4735). Accordingly, it has been proposed that reverse gyrase originated by the fusion of {DNA} helicase and {DNA} topoisomerase genes. If reverse gyrase is essential for life at high temperature, its composite structure suggests that {DNA} helicases and topoisomerases appeared independently and first evolved in a mesophilic world. Such scenario contradicts the hypothesis that a direct link connects present day hyperthermophiles to a hot origin of life. We discuss different patterns for the early cellular evolution in which reverse gyrase appeared either before the emergence of the last common ancestor of Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya, or in a lineage common to the two procaryotic domains. The latter scenario could explain why all today hyperthermophiles are procaryotes.},

The interplay between these colour-producing mechanisms may influence the efficacy and potential information content of colour signals, but this notion has received little empirical attention. Wing scales in the male orange sulphur butterfly (Colias eurytheme) possess ridges with lamellae that produce a brilliant iridescent ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance via thin-film interference. Curiously, these same scales contain pterin pigments that strongly absorb wavelengths below 550 nm. Given that male {UV} reflectance functions as a sexual signal in C. eurytheme, it is paradoxical that pigments in the wing scales are highly {UV} absorbing. We present spectrophotometric analyses of the wings before and after pterin removal that show that pterins both depress the amplitude of {UV} iridescence and suppress a diffuse {UV} reflectance that emanates from the scales. This latter effect enhances the directionality and spectral purity of the iridescence, and increases the signal's chromaticity and potential signal content. Our findings also suggest that pterins amplify the contrast between iridescent {UV} reflectance and scale background colour as a male's wings move during flight.},

There are substantially fewer studies on species with female-specific ornaments. However, no study so far investigated the potential of female-specific colouration as a quality signal in birds with conventional sex roles. We studied female-specific ornamentation in a strongly sexually dichromatic species, the upland goose Chloephaga picta leucoptera, in two consecutive years. Male upland geese have white head and breast feathers and black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown head and breast feathers and conspicuous yellow-orange legs. We found that female-specific colouration in upland geese can reliably indicate different aspects of female phenotypic quality. Females with more orange coloured legs and more red-like head colours had higher clutch and egg volumes than females with a paler leg and head colouration, and a more reddish plumage colouration was related to a higher body condition. These relationships provide the theoretic possibility for males to assess female phenotypic quality on the basis of colouration. Furthermore, the females with a more orange-like tarsus colouration had higher plasma carotenoid levels. Both tarsus colouration and carotenoid concentrations of individual females were highly correlated across years, indicating that tarsus colour is a stable signal. Despite this correlation, small individual differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations between the two study years were related to differences in tarsus colouration. We thus show for the first time in a wild bird and under natural conditions that carotenoid-based integument colouration remains consistent between individuals in consecutive years and is also a dynamic trait reflecting individual changes in carotenoid levels. In this species, where pairs form life-long bonds, the honesty of the carotenoid-based integument colouration suggests that it may be a sexually selected female ornament that has evolved through male mate choice.},

	abstract = {Structural colours of avian skin have long been hypothesized to be produced by incoherent (Rayleigh/Tyndall) scattering. We investigated the colour, anatomy, nanostructure and biophysics of structurally coloured skin, ramphotheca and podotheca from 31 species of birds from 17 families in 10 orders from across Aves. Integumentary structural colours of birds include ultraviolet, dark blue, light blue, green and yellow hues. The discrete peaks in reflectance spectra do not conform to the inverse fourth power relationship predicted by Rayleigh scattering. The dermis of structurally coloured skin consists of a thick (100-500 mum) layer of collagen that is usually underlain by a layer of melanin granules. Transmission electron micrographs ({TEMs}) of this colour-producing dermal collagen layer revealed quasi-ordered arrays of parallel collagen fibres. Two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of {TEMs} of the collagen arrays revealed a ring of peak spatial frequencies in the spatial variation in refractive index that are the appropriate size to make the observed ultraviolet-yellow colours by coherent scattering alone. One species, Philepitta castanea (Eurylaimidae), has exceptionally ordered, hexagonal arrays of collagen fibres that produce a hexagonal pattern of spatial frequency peaks in the power spectra. Ultraviolet, blue, green and yellow structural colours of avian skin are produced by coherent scattering (i.e. constructive interference) by arrays of collagen fibres in the dermis. Some yellow and orange skin colours are produced with a combination of structural and pigmentary mechanisms. These combined colours can have reflectance spectra with discrete peaks that are more saturated than hues produced by carotenoid pigments alone. Bluish facial skin from two species of Neotropical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) are nanostructurally too small to produce visible light by coherent scattering, and the colour production mechanism in these species remains unknown. Based on the phylogenetic distribution of structurally coloured skin in Aves, this mechanism of colour production has evolved convergently more than 50 independent times within extant birds.},

	abstract = {The role color signaling plays in the nocturnal condition of the terrestrial ecosystem is currently poorly understood. In general, arthropods active in the night are inconspicuously colored. However, in addition to inconspicuously colored dorsum, several genera of nocturnal orb spiders also have conspicuous ventrum spots. In this study, we tested whether the inconspicuously colored dorsum functioned to reduce spiders' visibility to diurnal predators while the spiders were perching on bark with ventrum spots well concealed. We also evaluated when spiders sit on webs with conspicuous ventrum spots fully exposed, would they serve as deceptive color signals to lure visually orientated nocturnal prey. We first quantified how diurnal hymenopteran predators viewed the dorsum and nocturnal lepidopteran prey viewed the ventrum spots of nocturnal orb spiders Neoscona punctigera by calculating color contrasts. The diurnal color contrast of spiders' dorsum when viewed by hymenopteran insects against bark was lower than the discrimination threshold. However, the nocturnal color contrasts of spiders' ventrum spots when viewed by moths were high. In the field, webs with N. punctigera intercepted significantly more insects than those without. When the color signal of ventrum spots was altered by paint, webs' prey interception rates decreased significantly. These results demonstrate that even in the nocturnal condition certain terrestrial organisms exhibit visual lures to attract prey.},

	abstract = {Flowering plants in Australia have been geographically isolated for more than 34 million years. In the Northern Hemisphere, previous work has revealed a close fit between the optimal discrimination capabilities of hymenopteran pollinators and the flower colours that have most frequently evolved. We collected spectral data from 111 Australian native flowers and tested signal appearance considering the colour discrimination capabilities of potentially important pollinators. The highest frequency of flower reflectance curves is consistent with data reported for the Northern Hemisphere. The subsequent mapping of Australian flower reflectances into a bee colour space reveals a very similar distribution of flower colour evolution to the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning. This observation suggests a requirement for plasticity in the nervous systems of pollinators to allow generalization of flowers of the same species while overcoming the possible presence of non-rewarding flower mimics.},

	abstract = {Receiver–bias models of signal evolution predict that male sexually selected traits evolve through prior selection for other functions. Female three–spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in many populations show a mating preference for males with a red throat and jaw. It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females in accordance with the Fisher–Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female three–spined and nine–spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context. This result demonstrates a correlation between a sexually selected trait and an intrinsic attraction to red objects, and supports the sensory–exploitation model for the evolution of red nuptial coloration in three–spined sticklebacks.},

Here, we report a simple aperiodic array of silicon nanotips on a 6-inch wafer with a sub-wavelength structure that can suppress the reflection of light at a range of wavelengths from the ultraviolet, through the visible part of the spectrum, to the terahertz region. Reflection is suppressed for a wide range of angles of incidence and for both s- and p-polarized light. The antireflection properties of the silicon result from changes in the refractive index caused by variations in the height of the silicon nanotips, and can be simulated with models that have been used to explain the low reflection from moth eyes. The improved anti-reflection properties of the surfaces could have applications in renewable energy and electro-optical devices for the military.},

Because of their highly conspicuous nature, long-range sexual signals are prime candidates to be used in evaluating the social conditions likely to be experienced upon adulthood in continuously breeding species; however, their role in mediating immune responses is unknown. We tested whether exposure to acoustic sexual signals in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus affects immunity by manipulating male juvenile experience of acoustic signals, and measuring the effect on adult immunity. Adult males exposed to song during rearing showed stronger immune responses than males reared in silence: they were better able to encapsulate artificial nylon implants and showed higher levels of antimicrobial lysozyme-like activity in their haemolymph. Experience of sexual signals thus translates into increased immunity, which suggests that such signals may play a role in conveying information about population demography and shaping density-dependent responses in unintended receivers.},

It follows that evolutionary changes in colour displays must reflect changes in the underlying production mechanisms, but rarely have the mechanisms of feather colour evolution been studied. Among bluebirds in the genus Sialia, male rump colour varies among species from dark blue to light blue while breast colour varies from blue to rusty. We use spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier analysis to identify the morphology responsible for these divergent colour displays. The morphology of blue rump barbs is similar among the three species, with an outer keratin cortex layer surrounding a medullary spongy layer' and a basal row of melanin granules. A spongy layer is also present in blue breast barbs of mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides and in rusty breast barbs of western Sialia mexicana and eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis. In blue barbs melanin is basal to the spongy layer, but is not present in the outer cortex or spongy layer, while in rusty barbs, melanin is present only in the cortex. The placement of melanin in the cortex masks expression of structural blue, creating a rusty display. Such shifts in microstructures and pigments may be widespread mechanisms for the evolutionary changes in the colours of feathers and other reflective structures across colourful organisms.},

	abstract = {Basic kinematic and detailed physical mechanisms of avian, non-vocal sound production are both unknown. Here, for the first time, field-generated high-speed video recordings and acoustic analyses are used to test numerous competing hypotheses of the kinematics underlying sonations, or non-vocal communicative sounds, produced by two genera of Pipridae, Manacus and Pipra (Aves). Eleven behaviorally and acoustically distinct sonations are characterized, five of which fall into a specific acoustic class of relatively loud, brief, broad-frequency sound pulses, or snaps. The hypothesis that one kinematic mechanism of snap production is used within and between birds in general, and manakins specifically, is rejected. Instead, it is verified that three of four competing hypotheses of the kinematic mechanisms used for producing snaps, namely: (1) above-the-back wing-against-wing claps, (2) wing-against-body claps and (3) wing-into-air flicks, are employed between these two clades, and a fourth mechanism, (4) wing-against-tail feather interactions, is discovered. The kinematic mechanisms used to produce snaps are invariable within each identified sonation, despite the fact that a diversity of kinematic mechanisms are used among sonations. The other six sonations described are produced by kinematic mechanisms distinct from those used to create snaps, but are difficult to distinguish from each other and from the kinematics of flight. These results provide the first detailed kinematic information on mechanisms of sonation in birds in general, and the Pipridae specifically. Further, these results provide the first evidence that acoustically similar avian sonations, such as brief, broad frequency snaps, can be produced by diverse kinematic means, both among and within species. The use of high-speed video recordings in the field in a comparative manner documents the diversity of kinematic mechanisms used to sonate, and uncovers a hidden, sexually selected radiation of behavioral and communicative diversity in the Pipridae.},

Selection for signal detectability under different habitat conditions has been proposed as a mechanism leading to the evolution of signal diversity. We examined dewlap color in four closely related species of Anolis lizards that occupy habitats with different light conditions. Initially, we tested the hypothesis that lizards choose specific light conditions within each habitat in which to signal. We rejected this hypothesis for all four species. We next calculated the detectability of the dewlap color of all four species at display locations in each habitat. If selection for detectability under the different light conditions explained the divergence in signal design, the occupant of a given habitat was predicted to have the highest signal detectability in that habitat. However, the rank order of detectability of the four dewlap colors was nearly the same in all four habitats. We concluded that divergent selection for signal detectability does not, by itself, explain the evolution of dewlap color diversity. We hypothesize that the evolution of dewlap color diversity results from simultaneous selection for multiple functions of dewlap color.},

The Diptera were collected monthly in the Reserve, between 2002 and 2005, totaling 24 samplings. Four traps containing sardines as bait were painted olive green, blood red, black, or white and exposed for 48 h at four equidistant points, 50 m from each other. To determine the calliphorid species constancy, the Bodenheirmer constancy index was used throughout the study. To analyze differences in the total abundance between species and in their color selection, an {ANCOVA} test with a significance level of 5 \% and a Tukey post-test were used, considering the categories species and color as co-factors and climatic variables as co-variables (temperature, relative humidity and precipitation), since the samples were collected over two years. 10,444 insects were captured. Of these, 56 \% belonged to the Calliphoridae family, totaling 13 species, with the most frequent species being Laneela nigripes (28.5 \%), Hemilucilia semidiaphana (17 \%), and Mesembrinella sp. (16.4 \%). The other species had frequencies lower than 12 \%. Nine species were considered constant, two accessories, and two accidental. The data indicated that the most frequent species presented significant differences between themselves concerning abundance over the captured months, however, the Tukey post-test indicated differences only between a few of them. The black trap presented the higher relative calliphorid frequency (27.34 \%), followed by green (25 \%), red (24.0 \%), and white (23.7 \%), although the species abundance in the different colored traps did not differ significantly among themselves. Therefore, there was no Calliphorid flies preference for any of the tested colors.},

	abstract = {Butterflies are among nature's most colourful animals, and provide a living showcase for how extremely bright, chromatic and iridescent coloration can be generated by complex optical mechanisms. The gross characteristics of male butterfly colour patterns are understood to function for species and/or sex recognition, but it is not known whether female mate choice promotes visual exaggeration of this coloration. Here I show that females of the sexually dichromatic species Hypolimnas bolina prefer conspecific males that possess bright iridescent blue/ultraviolet dorsal ornamentation. In separate field and enclosure experiments, using both dramatic and graded wing colour manipulations, I demonstrate that a moderate qualitative reduction in signal brightness and chromaticity has the same consequences as removing the signal entirely. These findings validate a long-held hypothesis, and argue for the importance of intra- versus interspecific selection as the driving force behind the exaggeration of bright, iridescent butterfly colour patterns.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory is primarily concerned with genetic processes, yet empirical testing of this theory often involves data collected on phenotypes. To make this tenable, the implicit assumption is often made that phenotypic patterns are good predictors of genetic patterns; an assumption that coined the phenotypic gambit. Although this assumption has been validated for traits with high heritability, such as morphology, its generality for traits with low heritabilities, such as life-history and behavioural traits, remains controversial. Using a large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable variation but common environment effects were found to be important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern. Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic correlations between some colour and skeletal traits. Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and life-history traits.},

	abstract = {Manipulation by parasites is a catchy concept that has been applied to a large range of phenotypic alterations brought about by parasites in their hosts. It has, for instance, been suggested that the carotenoid-based colour of acanthocephalan cystacanths is adaptive through increasing the conspicuousness of infected intermediate hosts and, hence, their vulnerability to appropriate final hosts such as fish predators. We revisited the evidence in favour of adaptive coloration of acanthocephalan parasites in relation to increased trophic transmission using the crustacean amphipod Gammarus pulex and two species of acanthocephalans, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Polymorphus minutus. Both species show carotenoid-based colorations, but rely, respectively, on freshwater fish and aquatic bird species as final hosts. In addition, the two parasites differ in the type of behavioural alteration brought to their common intermediate host. Pomphorhynchus laevis reverses negative phototaxis in G. pulex, whereas P. minutus reverses positive geotaxis. In aquaria, trout showed selective predation for P. laevis-infected gammarids, whereas P. minutus-infected ones did not differ from uninfected controls in their vulnerability to predation. We tested for an effect of parasite coloration on increased trophic transmission by painting a yellow-orange spot on the cuticle of uninfected gammarids and by masking the yellow-orange spot of infected individuals with inconspicuous brown paint. To enhance realism, match of colour between painted mimics and true parasite was carefully checked using a spectrometer. We found no evidence for a role of parasite coloration in the increased vulnerability of gammarids to predation by trout. Painted mimics did not differ from control uninfected gammarids in their vulnerability to predation by trout. In addition, covering the place through which the parasite was visible did not reduce the vulnerability of infected gammarids to predation by trout. We discuss alternative evolutionary explanations for the origin and maintenance of carotenoid-based colorations in acanthocephalan parasites.},

Females of few crab-spider species encounter such situations when lying on flowers to ambush pollinators. To evaluate the efficiency of spider camouflage on flowers, we measured by spectroradiometry adult female Thomisus onustus and marguerite daisies, Leucanthemum vulgare. We compared chromatic contrast (color used for short-range detection) of each pair of spider and flower to detection thresholds computed in the visual systems of both Hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predator. We also computed achromatic contrast (brightness) used for long-range detection. In both visual systems, each individual spider was efficiently matching the precise color of the flower center on which it was hunting. Being significantly darker than flowers, crab-spiders could in theory be detected at long range by either predator or prey using achromatic contrast. However, long-range detection is unlikely, owing to small spider size. Spiders also generated significant chromatic and achromatic contrasts to both Hymenoptera and bird when moving on flower periphery. Our study is the first to identify which photoreceptors of both prey and predator are involved in camouflage. The analysis suggests more research on bird predation and vision to determine to which extent bird predators effectively constrain spider crypsis.},

	abstract = {Dependent offspring use specialized traits to attract parental care. In birds, this includes morphological ornaments (e.g. colourful plumage or mouthparts) that are associated with nestling condition and shape the allocation of parental care. Ornament expression often differs among broods, even after differences in individual condition are accounted for statistically. Understanding how this variation arises is important for understanding the information content of these signals, their functional importance, and their evolution. The present study used a cross-fostering experiment to assess the relative contributions of parental effects to among-brood differences in the mouth coloration of nestling house sparrows, specifically the carotenoid-richness, overall brightness, and ultraviolet ({UV}) coloration of rictal flanges. The expression of carotenoid-based coloration was explained by synchronous breeding, nest-of-rearing and nest-of-origin. Brightness and relative {UV} intensity, however, were explained only by synchronous breeding, and there was substantial unexplained variation in all three colour parameters. Among-brood variation in mouth coloration, then, may primarily contain information about the environment in which offspring are reared. At the individual level, ontogenetic changes in the carotenoid-richness and brightness of flanges positively reflected mass gain (a proxy for food intake). Larger and yellower chicks gained more mass, consistent with parental preferences for these traits.

	abstract = {Floral signals are typically emitted across multiple sensory modalities, although why they are multimodal is unclear. One possible explanation is that multimodal signalling ensures that at least one signal component will be transmitted effectively under varying environmental conditions (the 'efficacy backup' hypothesis). For example, by transmitting both component A and B, a signaller can communicate under environmental conditions where transmission of component A is reduced; component B 'backs up' A. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether a floral scent could back up a floral colour signal when light levels were low. We trained nectar-foraging bumblebees to discriminate rewarding and unrewarding targets that differed in colour, scent, or both colour and scent, and then presented the targets at different levels of illumination. We measured bees' accuracy at distinguishing the two targets and their rate of visits to the trained target. Performance on both measures declined under low light when targets were unscented. The presence of scent reduced the loss of accuracy under low light, supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis, but this effect depended upon the colour of the previously rewarded target. In contrast, the presence of scent did not affect the overall rate of correct visits under low light (correct visits/foraging time). A backup mechanism that maintains accuracy, but not rate of nectar collection, does not necessarily benefit the pollinator. However, it most likely benefits the plant through reduced pollen wastage. In short, multimodal floral signals may benefit the plant by improving pollen transfer, while not benefiting the pollinator. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Here, we define mutualism as a reciprocal increase in fitness of the symbionts, and we review the evidence for mycorrhizal mutualism at the community, whole-plant, and cellular scales. It is difficult to use results of most mycorrhizal studies because (i) fungal contribution to nutrient uptake is not accurately estimated, (ii) increased growth is not necessarily correlated with increased plant fecundity or survival, especially in communities, and (iii) benefits that occur only at certain times of year, or under specific extreme conditions, may not be detected. To produce the nonmycorrhizal controls required to study mutualism in the field, soil microflora and fauna must be severely perturbed; therefore, it is virtually impossible to evaluate effects of mycorrhizas on plant fitness under realistic conditions. Using the evidence available, we conclude that mycorrhizas can occupy various positions along the continuum from parasitism to mutualism, depending on the specific plant and fungal genotypes and their abiotic and biotic environments. Although we discuss the possibility of defining mycorrhizas by some physiological characteristic, we conclude that mycorrhizas should be defined on a structural or developmental basis and that any requirement to demonstrate mutualism be eliminated.

On considère généralement les mycorhizes comme un cas de mutualisme classique. Les auteures décrivent le mutualisme comme une augmentation réciproque de l'adaptation des symbiotes, et elles revoient les preuves de mutualisme mycorhizien à l'échelle de la communauté, de la plante entière et de la cellule. Il est difficile d'utiliser les résultats de la plupart des études, parce que (i) la contribution du champignon dans l'apport de nutriments n'est pas suffisamment documentée, (ii) une croissance accrue n'est pas nécessairement corrélée avec une augmentation de la fécondité ou de la survie, surtout dans les communautés et (iii) les bénéfices qui peuvent survenir seulement à certains moments de l'année, ou sous certaines conditions extrêmes, peuvent ne pas être décelés. Afin de produire les témoins non mycorhiziens requis dans les études sur le mutualisme, conduites aux champs, la microflore et la microfaune du sol doivent être profondément perturbées, et il est conséquemment impossible d'évaluer les effets des mycorhizes sur l'adaptation de la plante sous des conditions réalistes. En utilisant les preuves disponibles, les auteurs concluent que les mycorhizes peuvent occuper diverses positions le long du continuum allant du parasitisme au mutualisme, selon les génotypes spécifiques des plantes et des champignons et selon leurs environnements abiotiques et biotiques. Bien que les auteures discutent la possibilité de définir les mycorhizes par certaines caractéristiques physiologiques, elles concluent que les mycorhizes devraient être décrites sur la base des structures et de leur développement, et que toute obligation d'en démontrer le mutualisme devrait être éliminée.

We investigate theoretically the effects of Wolbachia-induced bidirectional {CI} on levels of divergence between two populations, where there is migration in both directions and differential selection at a single locus. The main findings are as follows: Wolbachia differences in the two populations are maintained up to a threshold migration rate, above which the system collapses to a single Wolbachia type; differential selection at a nuclear locus increases the threshold migration rate below which Wolbachia polymorphisms are maintained; Wolbachia differences between the populations enhance their genetic divergence at the selected locus by reducing the "effective migration rate," and even moderate levels of {CI} can cause large population differences in allele frequencies; and asymmetric {CI} can induce strong asymmetries in effective migration rate and dramatically alter the pattern of genetic divergence compared with the No Wolbachia situation. We derive an analytical approximation for the effective migration rate, which matches the simulation results for most parameter values. These results generally support the view that {CI} Wolbachia can contribute to genetic divergence between populations.},

Because of the supernormal stimulus effect, mimetic signals may become quantitatively exaggerated relative to model stimuli. Viability selection or a decrease in responsiveness to signals that are exaggerated beyond their peak supernormal effect may limit signal elaboration. Females always benefit by responding to models and they may often benefit by responding to mimetic courtship signals. If the response as a preference is costly, it may be maintained by frequent and strong selection for the response to the model. I review five examples of courtship that illustrate the kinds of studies that can provide evidence of sensory traps. The strategic designs of mimetic courtship signals arise not from selection of responses to them but from selection for responses to models. This results from deceit by mimicry and the evolution of sensory trap responses before the signals that elicit them as preferences.},

The scales responsible for this are composed of a chitin-air-chitin sandwich in which the chitin layers are three-quarters of a wavelength thick and the air gap a quarter wavelength (where \{lambda\}=600 nm, the peak wavelength of the principal reflection maximum). It is shown that this configuration produces a second reflectance peak at approximately 385 nm, accounting for the observed reflection in the ultraviolet. Other scales have a similar thickness of chitin but lack the air gap and thus produce a dull purple reflection. This novel mechanism provides the spiders with two colour signals, both of which are important in mating displays.},

We test the hypothesis that, for primates, an advantage of trichromacy over dichromacy, in which such colors are apt to be confused, lies in the detection of yellow, orange, or red ({YOR}) food patches at a distance, while controlling for the potentially confounding influences of reproductive status and memory of food patch locations. We employ socially monogamous titi monkeys (Callicebus brunneus) which, like most platyrrhine primates, have polymorphic color vision resulting in populations containing both dichromatic and trichromatic individuals. Wild Callicebus brunneus spent most foraging time in {YOR} food patches, the locations of most of which were likely to have been memorable for the subjects. Overall, both dichromatic and trichromatic females had significantly higher encounter rates than their dichromatic male pair mates for low-yield ephemeral {YOR} food patches whose locations were less likely to have been remembered. We detected no difference in the encounter rates of dichromatic and trichromatic females for such patches. However, the data suggest that such a difference may be detectable with a larger sample of groups of Callicebus brunneus, a larger sample of foraging observations per group, or both. We propose that a trichromatic advantage for foraging primates may be realized only when individuals' energy requirements warrant searching for nonmemorable {YOR} food patches, a context for selection considerably more limited than is often assumed in explanations of the evolution of primate color vision.},

	abstract = {Patterns of biodiversity are often explained by ecological processes, where traits that promote novel ways of interacting with the environment (key innovations) play a fundamental role in promoting diversification. However, sexual selection and social competition can also promote diversification through rapid evolution of ornamental traits. Because selection can operate only on existing variation, the tendency of ornamental traits to constrain or enable the production of novel phenotypes is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of diversification. Starlings are a speciose group characterized by diverse iridescent colors produced by nanometer-scale arrays of melanin-containing organelles (melanosomes) that play a central role in sexual selection and social competition. We show that evolutionary lability of these colors is associated with both morphological and lineage diversification in African starlings. The solid rod-like melanosome morphology has evolved in a directional manner into three more optically complex forms that can produce a broader range of colors than the ancestral form, resulting in (i) faster color evolution, (ii) the occupation of novel, previously unreachable regions of colorspace, and ultimately (iii) accelerated lineage diversification. As in adaptive radiations, key innovations in ornament production can provide high phenotypic trait variability, leading to dramatic effects on the tempo and mode of diversification.},

For example, female mandrills possess facial coloration that ranges from black to bright pink. We used fortnightly photographs of 52 semi-free-ranging females aged above 3 years over 19 months to evaluate whether colour conveys information concerning female competitive ability, reproductive quality, age or reproductive status. Colour was not related to female rank or quality (body mass index, age at first birth or mean inter-birth interval); however, colour did increase significantly with age and primiparous females were darker than multiparous females. Colour may therefore signal reproductive quality, as younger females are less fertile and produce smaller offspring. Colour was brighter during the follicular phase than during the luteal phase, suggesting that it may signal fertility. Colour also varied across gestation and peaked at four and eight weeks post-parturition, suggesting that it may signal approaching parturition and lactation. Future studies should examine the relationship between colour and the menstrual cycle in more detail, the hormonal basis of female colour, and determine experimentally whether mandrills of both sexes attend to differences in colour between and within females.},

	abstract = {It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Impressive variation in egg colouration among birds has puzzled evolutionary biologists for a long time. The most frequently studied selective forces moulding egg colouration-predation and brood parasitism-have either received little empirical support or may play a role in only a minority of species. A novel hypothesis has suggested that egg colour may be significantly influenced by sexual selection. Females may deposit a blue-green pigment biliverdin into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as a powerful antioxidant. By this handicap, females may signal their quality to males, which are then hypothesized to increase their paternal effort. We experimentally tested the hypothesis in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a species laying blue-green eggs. We cross-fostered clutches between nests to disentangle effects of female/territory quality and egg colour on paternal effort and nestling quality. The results supported two assumptions of sexual signalling through egg colour hypothesis: Blue pigment seems to be a limited resource for females, and female quality is positively correlated with the intensity of the blue-green colour. However, we did not find support for the main prediction of the hypothesis, as male parental effort parameters (feeding frequencies to nestlings and intensity of nest defence) were unrelated to egg colour. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and previous correlative analyses that supported the hypothesis that blue egg colour may be a postmating, sexually selected signal in females.},

	abstract = {The red-legged frog, Rana aurora, has been recognized as both a single, polytypic species and as two distinct species since its original description 150 years ago. It is currently recognized as one species with two geographically contiguous subspecies, aurora and draytonii; the latter is protected under the {US} Endangered Species Act. We present the results of a survey of 50 populations of red-legged frogs from across their range plus four outgroup species for variation in a phylogenetically informative, ∼400 base pairs (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our {mtDNA} analysis points to several major results. (1) In accord with several other lines of independent evidence, aurora and draytonii are each diagnosably distinct, evolutionary lineages; the {mtDNA} data indicate that they do not constitute a monophyletic group, but rather that aurora and R. cascadae from the Pacific northwest are sister taxa; (2) the range of the draytonii {mtDNA} clade extends about 100 km further north in coastal California than was previously suspected, and corresponds closely with the range limits or phylogeographical breaks of several codistributed taxa; (3) a narrow zone of overlap exists in southern Mendocino County between aurora and draytonii haplotypes, rather than a broad intergradation zone; and (4) the critically endangered population of draytonii in Riverside County, {CA} forms a distinct clade with frogs from Baja California, Mexico. The currently available evidence favours recognition of aurora and draytonii as separate species with a narrow zone of overlap in northern California. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

We tested the hypothesis that females use male plumage brightness as a criterion in choosing mates. In a mate-choice aviary, we presented females with a choice between males whose feathers were either brightened with blue marker or dulled with black marker. Treatment resulted in an increase in the plumage intensity (reflectance at peak wavelength) of blue-treated males and a decrease in the intensity of black-treated males within the natural range of variation, while the wavelength of peak reflection (hue) remained unchanged. During mate choice trials, females consistently preferred particular males, but choice was random with respect to treatment. Thus, the intensity of blue coloration of male Blue Grosbeaks appears not to function as a criterion in female mate choice.},

	abstract = {An analysis of intraspecific variation in the fossorial skink Microacontias litoralis revealed that orange-coloured and melanistic individuals co-occur at several localities. Body colour was found to be independent of sex and body size, Both orange-coloured and melanistic in situ embryos were present in pregnant females, showing that colour polymorphism is not the result of ontogenetic changes induced by environmental conditions, but rather has a genetic basis. The presence of orange-coloured embryos in melanistic females and vice-versa shows that breeding in these two colour morphs is not isolated. The functional significance of colour polymorphism in M. litoralis remains unclear, but intraspecific communication or background colour matching as possible selective advantages of melanism are ruled out. Microacontias litoralis is endemic to the west coast of South Africa where there is in general a high incidence of melanistic lizard species and populations associated with zones of upwelling of cold water in the Atlantic Ocean. That the melanistic morph may represent past or present selection for thermal melanism can not be ruled out and further investigation is required.},

	abstract = {The mouth coloration of passerine nestlings is hypothesized to attract parental care by increasing the visual conspicuousness of begging chicks and/or by signaling the reproductive value of nestlings. Specifically, carotenoids are often hypothesized to mediate the latter relationship. In House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings, we confirmed both the presence of carotenoids in rictal flanges and a positive relationship between carotenoid concentration and the intensity of yellow coloration. This carotenoid-based coloration was positively associated with nestling mass and with plasma carotenoid concentration. Red gape coloration also revealed titers of circulating carotenoids. Carotenoids reduced the overall brightness and the {UV} reflectance of flanges, an effect that may limit the detectability of carotenoid-rich mouth colors and the ability of brightness and {UV} coloration to function in communication. For example, flange brightness, likely the primary determinant of conspicuousness, was positively related to nestling mass and levels of circulating carotenoids but only when the reflectance effect of carotenoids was removed statistically. We found no evidence that {UV} coloration positively reflected nestling condition. Most aspects of mouth coloration were influenced by Julian date and differed among broods, suggesting that colors can capture information about temporal and nontemporal features of the environment experienced by nestlings and, furthermore, could have a genetic component.},

Reflectance values of sexually dichromatic red plumage patches were measured on study skins. Total reflectance, reflectance in the short wavelength part of the spectrum, and several measures of spectral shape were extracted directly from the spectra. Our analyses revealed that S. loyca and S. defilippii were brighter and had higher reflectance in the short wavelength part of the spectrum than S. superciliaris. Minimum reflectance was located at higher wavelengths in breeding than in nonbreeding plumage. Interspecific distances in avian visual space obtained from the Vorobyev and Osorio (1998) model were considerably higher than the threshold value for color discrimination, indicating that the differences found are also detectable by birds. Taken together, these results show that the red plumage patches of these three species present significant color differences throughout the year, not only in the visible but also in the {UV} part of the spectrum.},

The zebrafish, Danio rerio, displays a striking pattern of dark stripes of melanophores interspersed by light stripes of xanthophores. Mutants lacking either cell type do not form proper stripes, indicating that interactions between these two chromatophore types are required for stripe formation. A third cell type, silvery iridophores, participates to render a shiny appearance to the pattern, but its role in stripe formation has been unclear. Mutations in rose (rse) or shady (shd) cause a lack or strong reduction of iridophores in adult fish; in addition, the melanophore number is drastically reduced and stripes are broken up into spots. We show that rse and shd are autonomously required in iridophores, as mutant melanophores form normal sized stripes when confronted with wild-type iridophores in chimeric animals. We describe stripe formation in mutants missing one or two of the three chromatophore types. None of the chromatophore types alone is able to create a pattern but residual stripe formation occurs with two cell types. Our analysis shows that iridophores promote and sustain melanophores. Furthermore, iridophores attract xanthophores, whereas xanthophores repel melanophores. We present a model for the interactions between the three chromatophore types underlying stripe formation. Stripe formation is initiated by iridophores appearing at the horizontal myoseptum, which serves as a morphological landmark for stripe orientation, but is subsequently a self-organising process.},

While behavioural tests have diagnosed these animals as trichromats and electrophysiological studies have diagnosed them as monochromats, recent molecular genetics studies provide evidence for dichromatic colour vision, having found two classes of cone opsins in a species of this genus. This study examines the colour perception of a male and female white-eared opossum, Didelphis albiventris, through a series of tasks involving a behavioural paradigm of discrimination learning. Both opossums succeeded in discriminating pairs of stimuli consisting of Munsell colour cards presented in random brightness values that are assumed to be easily discriminated by dichromats and trichromats (e.g. blues versus oranges). However, both subjects failed to discriminate between colours that are expected to be easily discriminated only by trichromats (e.g. greens versus oranges). The opossums were also unsuccessful in distinguishing a colour against itself (e.g. oranges versus oranges), demonstrating that discrimination was based only on visual cues. These results are consistent with recent predictions based on molecular genetics suggesting that the genus Didelphis is routinely a dichromat.

	abstract = {Wolbachia is a maternally inherited bacterium that is widely distributed among arthropods, in which it manipulates the reproduction of its hosts. Although generally facultative for its hosts, Wolbachia has recently become obligatory in Asobara tabida (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in which it is required for the completion of oogenesis. Here, we describe a new Wolbachia strain ({wAjap}) that is associated with the genus Asobara and infects Asobara japonica. {wAjap} was detected in all female-biased populations of A. japonica found in the main islands of Japan, but not in the arrhenotokous populations from the southern islands. Using phylogenetic analyses based on multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}), we show that this strain is closely related to {wAtab}3 (the strain required for oogenesis in A. tabida), even though they differ on Wolbachia surface protein ({WSP}) and {WO} phage sequences. Using antibiotic treatments, we show that cured thelytokous females are not dependent on Wolbachia for oogenesis. However, they produced only sons, showing that {wAjap} induces thelytokous parthenogenesis. Analyses of mating behavior and offspring production of individuals from Wolbachia-infected populations showed that while males were still sexually functional, females no longer attract males, making Wolbachia an obligate partner for daughter production in thelytokous populations. The fact that Wolbachia has become independently obligatory in two species of the same genus tends to show that dependence evolution can be common and swift, although no clear benefit for the parasitoid can be attributed to this dependence. Although dependence should lead to co-divergence between Wolbachia and its hosts, the very few cases of co-speciation observed in host-Wolbachia associations question the stability of these obligatory associations.

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based colour expression is frequently involved in sexual dichromatism, particularly in bird plumage, suggesting a role in sexual selection. Despite much work on expression of the carotenoid-based ventral plumage coloration of the great tit (Parus major), which represents a popular model in evolution and ecology, a consensus on even the most basic demographic patterns of variation (e.g. age and sex differences) is lacking. This may reflect the use of variable methods for analysing colour variation, although what is not clear, either in this case or in general, is the extent to which these alternative methods are equally effective at describing age- and sex-related dichromatism. Using data obtained over 4 years from a large sample of free-ranging great tits, we examined how colour-scoring methodology influences estimates of age- and sex-related dichromatism. We compare: (1) principal components analysis-derived scores; (2) tristimulus colour variables; (3) a visual model-independent, carotenoid-focussed colour score; and (4) two colour scoring methods based on avian visual models, examining how they assess colour variation with respect to age and sex to determine how methodology may influence results. We demonstrate clear age- and sex-dependent expression of this colour trait, both in our own data and in meta-analyses of results from great tit populations across Europe, and discuss the merits of the various colour scores, which yield very different estimates of the extent of age- and sex-dependent dichromatism. We show variation is likely to be visible to conspecifics and propose a novel, visual model-derived scoring system for describing variation in carotenoid-based colour patches, where the perceived signal is divided into independent chromatic and achromatic components, in line with current understanding of visual perception. The present study highlights the impact of colour-scoring methodology and shows that, as novel measures continue to be developed, researchers should consider carefully how they quantify colour expression.

However, egg size had a significant influence on the rates of egg consumption. Generalized linear mixed models showed that hedgehogs preferred to consume smaller quail eggs (91\%, n = 65) than intermediate partridge eggs (44\%, n = 110), whereas the largest chicken eggs (n = 50) were not consumed at all.

Immune response as reflected in hematocrit, immunoglobulin levels, and wing web swelling (a measure of cell-mediated immunity) was stronger in males that later became dominant, both before and after flock formation, although the difference between dominant and subordinate birds was more pronounced after males were housed in the multi-male groups. Dominant and subordinate males also differed in the relationship between comb length and wing web swelling. Among dominant males, individuals with larger combs had significantly larger swellings after flock formation, whereas within the subordinate males, those with relatively larger combs had worse cell-mediated immunity than those with smaller combs.

	abstract = {Background: The coevolution of male traits and female mate preferences has led to the elaboration and diversification of sexually selected traits; however the mechanisms that mediate trait-preference coevolution are largely unknown. Carotenoid acquisition and accumulation are key determinants of the expression of male sexually selected carotenoid-based coloration and a primary mechanism maintaining the honest information content of these signals. Carotenoids also influence female health and reproduction in ways that may alter the costs and benefits of mate choice behaviours and thus provide a potential biochemical link between the expression of male traits and female preferences. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the dietary carotenoid levels of captive female house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) and assessed their mate choice behavior in response to color-manipulated male finches. Results: Females preferred to associate with red males, but carotenoid supplementation did not influence the direction or strength of this preference. Females receiving a low-carotenoid diet were less responsive to males in general, and discrimination among the colorful males was positively linked to female plasma carotenoid levels at the beginning of the study when the diet of all birds was carotenoid-limited. Conclusions: Although female preference for red males was not influenced by carotenoid intake, changes in mating responsiveness and discrimination linked to female carotenoid status may alter how this preference is translated into choice. The reddest males, with the most carotenoid rich plumage, tend to pair early in the breeding season. If carotenoid-related variations in female choice behaviour shift the timing of pairing, then they have the potential to promote assortative mating by carotenoid status and drive the evolution of carotenoid-based male plumage coloration.},

On the other hand, it has been suggested that both variation in the background where the signal is displayed as well as variation in predators' probability to attack defended prey may favor intermediate signals or relax selection for signal monomorphism. We studied the direction and strength of selection for the hind wing color (orange vs. red) of female Parasemia plantaginis moths. Birds found the moths aversive and avoided them by sight both in laboratory and field experiments. A laboratory experiment with great tits showed that birds can discriminate between orange and red wings and attack red females less than orange females. This directional selection should decrease variation in hind wing color. However, the hind wing color did not significantly affect the "survival" of dead specimens under natural field conditions in a multipredator community. In addition, even though both orange and red were highly conspicuous against green leaves and silver birch trunks (backgrounds used in the studies), the magnitude of avian-perceived chromatic contrast (conspicuousness) differed against these backgrounds. Our results suggest that depending on the signal environment (background, predator community) directional selection for the warning signal monomorphism can be relaxed.},

	abstract = {In many avian species, males display dramatic and conspicuous ornaments that serve as honest signals of quality to females. The phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis suggests that the honesty of these signals may be maintained through a link with fertility. Indeed, in some recent studies, bright coloration has been linked with better fertility and also indicates semen characteristics that influence fertility, such as sperm performance. However, most of these studies were performed on species with ornamental feather coloration, in which the ornament is produced months prior to reproduction. We tested the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis in the domestic rooster, a species where comb characteristics fluctuate on a short-term basis according to environmental and physiological conditions and thus may serve as immediate signals of quality to hens. We examined the relationships of comb size and color with measures of sperm quality, including concentration, mobility, and viability. We found that comb size was inversely correlated, whereas comb color was positively correlated with sperm viability. Thus, males with the smallest reddest combs had the highest percentage of viable sperm. Our finding that comb color signals better quality sperm supports the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. However, the negative relationship between comb size and sperm viability indicates that females who choose larger ornaments also choose males with lower fertility, a counterintuitive behavior in terms of the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. To understand these signals in an adaptive context, it is important to determine how each individual comb characteristic is interpreted and utilized by females during mate choice.},

Male eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, display brilliant ultraviolet ({UV})-blue plumage coloration on their heads, backs, wings and tails and chestnut coloration on their breasts, which is positively correlated with condition, reproductive effort and reproductive success. We tested the hypothesis that female bluebirds prefer males that display brighter and more chromatic coloration by experimentally widowing males in the field and allowing replacement females to choose partners. We controlled for the influence of territory quality on female choice by widowing dyads of males with adjacent territories. We found no evidence that {UV}-blue or chestnut plumage coloration, body size or body condition predicted the male with which a female would pair.

We assessed whether the white plumage of Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus functioned as a social signal and, if so, how coloration and behavioural adaptations enhance signal efficacy. Signalling theory predicts that: (1) the colour properties of plumage should vary across the body, with the brightest parts being those involved in visual display performance; (2) specific displays calling attention to or enhancing detection or conspicuousness to conspecifics should be evident; and (3) location of the signallers should be such that signal efficacy is optimized. All three predictions were supported. The brightest areas of the plumage (particularly the face, throat and upper breast) were always unspotted, and white is particularly effective in open habitats characteristic of this species. The birds displayed a specific posture and orientated toward the sun preferentially on sunny days, and Owls with the whitest (least spotted) plumage displayed more and signalled more frequently from perches on the ground, where albedo from the snow may enhance the visual display. Snowy Owls integrate coloration, behaviour and environment through habitat selection to maximize the efficacy of their visual displays.},

	abstract = {Aim Studies of the spatial and temporal patterns of phenotypic diversity help to elucidate the fine-scale evolutionary and ecological mechanisms underlying geographical differentiation. The red-eyed tree frog, Agalychnis callidryas, is a widespread Neotropical frog that exhibits a broad range of polymorphism of coloration and flank-stripe pattern. The goal of this study was two-fold: first, to investigate the stability of polymorphisms over a 38-year period; and second, to evaluate biogeographical hypotheses of diversification between lower Central American populations through quantification of phenotypic diversity on a fine geographical scale. Location This study was conducted at 12 sites across four biogeographical regions in Costa Rica and Panama. Methods We quantified colour, categorized flank-stripe pattern from digital photos taken during field sampling, and measured body size for each individual. We compared the regional frequency of each flank-stripe pattern in 2005 with the frequency distribution from a previous study of the same sites in 1967 using logistic regression analyses. We determined the geographical signal of leg coloration by employing linear discriminant function analyses to generate a classification matrix based on covariance similarities, and by comparison of the average hue values within and between regions. Results We found a temporal shift in the frequency of flank-stripe patterns in three of four regions over 38 years. Based on measures of leg coloration, the frequency distribution of flank-stripe patterns and body size, we conclude that A. callidryas populations are easily distinguishable at a regional scale. Main conclusions Agalychnis callidryas exhibits regional differentiation in all phenotypic traits measured in this study, supporting the role of three major biogeographical barriers to gene exchange. We found evidence of a putative contact zone between polytypic regions in Costa Rica. In addition, we report temporal instability of the relative frequency of stripe patterns located on the flanks. The ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that may underlie this variation include sexual selection and avoidance of predators.},

Much is known about winter territory use and habitat segregation by male and female kestrels, but possible relationships among morphological features, individual quality and habitat quality have not been examined. Our objective was to examine possible relationships between morphology, territory quality, and skin color of American Kestrels. Male kestrels had brighter skin than females, and the skin color of male kestrels was positively correlated with size (wing chord and tail length) and territorial quality (hunting territories with less canopy and more grass cover). No such relationships were found for female kestrels. Skin color appears to be an honest indicator of quality for male American Kestrels and may serve both intersexual (territory acquisition) and intersexual (mate choice) functions during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons.},

If it declines more quickly amongst birds in poor condition, it has the potential to act as an honest signal of individual quality and therefore be subject to social and sexual selection. We scored plumage immaculateness in shelducks Tadorna tadorna , based on the absence of white feathers in the red-brown chest band and the evenness of the band's border. We monitored body condition and plumage quality in birds at feeding sites in the Severn Estuary ({UK}) during the early breeding season when females were forming eggs, and later in the season when chicks arrived. Drakes had more immaculate chest bands than ducks. At preferred feeding sites, drakes were more immaculate, and birds of both sexes were in better body condition. Birds with more immaculate plumage tended to mate assortatively at preferred sites and were more likely to produce a brood that survived the journey to the feeding areas. Immaculateness could therefore be an honest signal of parental quality. Although our evidence is only correlational, we suggest that plumage immaculateness indicates the ability to establish and maintain control over the best breeding sites and feeding territories in the face of competition with other shelducks.},

We report that the carotenoid pigments in the integument of guppies are predominantly esters of tunaxanthin.

Carotenoid composition of the general integument of females and the non-orange spot fraction of males, but not of the orange spot fraction of males, varied with diet, correlating with the ratio beta-carotene to lutein in the different streams. Male guppies deposit higher concentrations of carotenoids in their orange spots than in the rest of the integument ( five to nine times higher), but not at the expense of the general integument, which was similarly endowed as the general integument of females, even in carotenoid-poor streams. Presumably males absorb/retain more pigments than females.

	abstract = {Abstract
The pantropical orb web spider family Nephilidae is known for the most extreme sexual size dimorphism among terrestrial animals. Numerous studies have made Nephilidae, particularly Nephila, a model lineage in evolutionary research. However, a poorly understood phylogeny of this lineage, relying only on morphology, has prevented thorough evolutionary syntheses of nephilid biology. We here use three nuclear and five mitochondrial genes for 28 out of 40 nephilid species to provide a more robust nephilid phylogeny and infer clade ages in a fossil-calibrated Bayesian framework. We complement the molecular analyses with total evidence analysis including morphology. All analyses find strong support for nephilid monophyly and exclusivity and the monophyly of the genera Herennia and Clitaetra. The inferred phylogenetic structure within Nephilidae is novel and conflicts with morphological phylogeny and traditional taxonomy. Nephilengys species fall into two clades, one with Australasian species (true Nephilengys) as sister to Herennia, and another with Afrotropical species (Nephilingis Kuntner new genus) as sister to a clade containing Clitaetra plus most currently described Nephila. Surprisingly, Nephila is also diphyletic, with true Nephila containing N. pilipes + N. constricta, and the second clade with all other species sister to Clitaetra; this “Nephila” clade is further split into an Australasian clade that also contains the South American N. sexpunctata and the Eurasian N. clavata, and an African clade that also contains the Panamerican N. clavipes. An approximately unbiased test constraining the monophyly of Nephilengys, Nephila, and Nephilinae (Nephila, Nephilengys, Herennia), respectively, rejected Nephilengys monophyly, but not that of Nephila and Nephilinae. Further data are therefore necessary to robustly test these two new, but inconclusive findings, and also to further test the precise placement of Nephilidae within the Araneoidea. For divergence date estimation we set the minimum bound for the stems of Nephilidae at 40 Ma and of Nephila at 16 Ma to accommodate Palaeonephila from Baltic amber and Dominican Nephila species, respectively. We also calibrated and dated the phylogeny under three different interpretations of the enigmatic 165 Ma fossil Nephila jurassica, which we suspected based on morphology to be misplaced. We found that by treating N. jurassica as stem Nephila or nephilid the inferred clade ages were vastly older, and the mitochondrial substitution rates much slower than expected from other empirical spider data. This suggests that N. jurassica is not a Nephila nor a nephilid, but possibly a stem orbicularian. The estimated nephilid ancestral age (40–60 Ma) rejects a Gondwanan origin of the family as most of the southern continents were already split at that time. The origin of the family is equally likely to be African, Asian, or Australasian, with a global biogeographic history dominated by dispersal events. A reinterpretation of web architecture evolution suggests that a partially arboricolous, asymmetric orb web with a retreat, as exemplified by both groups of “Nephilengys”, is plesiomorphic in Nephilidae, that this architecture was modified into specialized arboricolous webs in Herennia and independently in Clitaetra, and that the web became aerial, gigantic, and golden independently in both “Nephila” groups. The new topology questions previously hypothesized gradual evolution of female size from small to large, and rather suggests a more mosaic evolutionary pattern with independent female size increases from medium to giant in both “Nephila” clades, and two reversals back to medium and small; combined with male size evolution, this pattern will help detect gross evolutionary events leading to extreme sexual size dimorphism, and its morphological and behavioral correlates.},

In the present paper we analyze this aspect of the origin of life problem and offer arguments in favor of the 'replication first' school. Utilizing Wicken's two-tier approach to causation we argue that a causal connection between replication and metabolism can only be demonstrated if replication would have preceded metabolism. In conjunction with existing empirical evidence and theoretical reasoning, our analysis concludes that there is no substantive evidence for a 'metabolism first' mechanism for life's emergence, while a coherent case can be made for the 'replication first' group of mechanisms. The analysis reaffirms our conviction that life is an extreme expression of kinetic control, and that the emergence of metabolic pathways can be understood by considering life as a manifestation of 'replicative chemistry'.},

Since the colour pattern of a butterfly wing is formed as a mosaic of differently coloured scales, several questions naturally arise: are the microstructures the same between the blue and white scales? How is the distinctive whiteness produced, structurally or by means of pigmentation? To answer these questions, we have performed structural and optical investigations of the stripe pattern of a butterfly, Morpho cypris. It is found that besides the dorsal and ventral scale layers, the wing substrate also has the corresponding stripe pattern. Quantitative optical measurements and analysis using a simple model for the wing structure reveal the origin of the higher reflectance which makes the white stripe brighter.},

We used light-adapted hatchlings to determine the minimum intensity of blue (450 nm), green (500 nm), and yellow (580 nm) visual stimuli that evoked a positive phototaxis (the phototaxis "threshold" [pt]). Juvenile turtles. were later trained to associate each color (presented at 1 log unit above that color's pt) with food, then to discriminate between two colors (the original rewarded stimulus plus one of the other colors, not rewarded) when both were presented at 1 log unit above their pt. In the crucial test, turtles were trained to choose between the rewarded and unrewarded color when the colors varied in intensity. All turtles learned that task, demonstrating color discrimination. An association between blue and food was acquired in fewer trials than between yellow and food, perhaps because some prey of juvenile loggerheads in oceanic surface waters (jellyfishes, polyps, and pelagic gastropods) are blue or violet in color.},

As these constituents often have differing spectral properties, the relative and absolute concentrations of different carotenoids deposited in a signal can significantly affect the spectrum of light reflected. A critical but rarely tested assumption of hypotheses concerning the information content of carotenoid-based signals is that their colour directly reveals the concentration and composition of constituent carotenoids to intended recipients. Most previous studies have attempted to address this question using either photographic techniques or by analysing recorded reflectance spectra, neither of which take into account the specific properties of the receiver's visual system. 2. Here, we use psychophysical models of the visual system of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to estimate their sensitivity to variation in the concentration and relative abundance of constituent carotenoids of males' carotenoid-based sexual signals. 3. We demonstrate that sticklebacks are acutely sensitive to variation in both the total concentration of carotenoids in the signal and the relative proportion of its constituents, and that the accuracy of these assessments is largely unaffected by the presence or absence of ultraviolet radiation in the illuminant. We discuss these findings in relation to the evolution, maintenance and information content of carotenoid-based sexual signals.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Replication of experiments is essential for distinguishing real effects from type 1 errors and idiosyncrasies. One of the most replicated experiments in behavioral ecology is the presumed manipulation of male attractiveness in zebra finches by adding red or green color bands. Red-banded males were found to have higher fitness than green-banded males, and most empirical evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by female mating preferences rather than by male-male competition. A recent study, however, reported that color bands affected male courtship rate and body mass independently of female behavior. If this effect was real, some earlier findings of female preferences and maternal effects on offspring traits could potentially be reinterpreted as being mediated indirectly via effects on male behavior. This new perspective seems appealing also in light of a growing interest in bi-directional feedback mechanisms between endocrinology and ornamentation. However, here we report four independent failures to replicate this effect of color bands on courtship rate and body mass. Combining this new experimental data with all the published evidence in a meta-analysis shows that color bands seem to affect neither male courtship rate (average effect size d = 0.02) nor male body mass (d = −0.07). The present case is a reminder that replication of experiments lies at the heart of distinguishing between real effects and false positive findings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We quantified both ectoparasite load and the intensity of infection from blood parasites. In iridescent blue adult males, plumage reflectance is unimodal, with a single peak in the ultraviolet. while in greenish females and juveniles, plumage reflectance is bimodal, with peaks in both the ultraviolet and green portions of the spectrum. In adult males, the intensity of infection from blood parasites was best predicted by plumage brightness (total reflectance), with brighter males having fewer parasites. Similarly, juvenile males exhibiting greater {UV} chroma (proportion of reflectance in the {UV}) had fewer blood parasites.

Differential predation risk between individuals is often invoked to explain colour variation, but empirical support for this hypothesis is equivocal. We investigated differential conspicuousness and predation risk in two species of Australian rock dragons, Ctenophorus decresii and C. vadnappa. To humans, the coloration of males of these species varies between 'bright' and 'dull'. Visual modelling based on objective colour measurements and the spectral sensitivities of avian visual pigments showed that dragon colour variants are differentially conspicuous to the visual system of avian predators when viewed against the natural background. We conducted field experiments to test for differential predation risk, using plaster models of 'bright' and 'dull' males. 'Bright' models were attacked significantly more often than 'dull' models suggesting that differential conspicuousness translates to differential predation risk in the wild. We also examined the influence of natural geographical range on predation risk. Results from 22 localities suggest that predation rates vary according to whether predators are familiar with the prey species. This study is among the first to demonstrate both differential conspicuousness and differential predation risk in the wild using an experimental protocol.

	abstract = {Fog is thought to influence ecological function in coastal forests worldwide, yet few data are available that illuminate the mechanisms underlying this influence. In a California redwood forest we measured water and nitrogen (N) fluxes from horizontally moving fog and vertically delivered rain as well as redwood tree function. The spatial heterogeneity of water and N fluxes, water availability, tree water use, and canopy N processing varied greatly across seasons. Water and N fluxes to soil (annual average of 98\% and 89\%, respectively) across the whole forest occurred primarily in the rain season and was relatively even across the whole forest. In contrast, below-canopy flux of fog water and N declined exponentially from the windward edge to the forest interior. Following large fog events, soil moisture was greater at the windward edge than anywhere else in the forest. Physiological activity in redwoods reflected these differences in inputs across seasons: tree physiological responses did not vary spatially in the rain season, but in the fog season, water use was greater, yet water stress was less, in trees at the windward edge of the forest versus the interior. In both seasons, vertical passage through the forest changed the amount of water and form and concentration of N, revealing the role of the tree canopy in processing atmospheric inputs. Although total fog water inputs were comparatively small, they may have important ecosystem functions, including relief of canopy water stress and, where there is fog drip, functional coupling of above- and belowground processes.},

	abstract = {Elaborate secondary sexual traits, such as plumage ornaments, are important signals in reproductive communication and so it is important to maintain them in good condition. Time and energy spent in their maintenance reinforce the honesty of the ornamental traits. Variation in plumage visual properties as a function of maintenance has until now received little attention. Here, we used a combination of spectroradiometric measurements of plumage coloration, a physiological model of bird vision and behavioural observations to investigate how grooming behaviours affect plumage coloration in experimentally soiled male domestic canaries. Although showing a similar total amount of grooming, dirty males showed more feather ruffling and less preening than control males, suggesting that removal of dirt does not require an increase in grooming activity and that ruffling is likely to be more efficient for removing dirt. Grooming activities were not correlated with changes in plumage reflectance, probably because the same grooming behaviour is more efficient at removing feather dirt when performed by some individuals than by others. Dirty males were distinguishable in coloration up to 2.5 h after soiling. Shoulders and throat were the dirtiest of all body parts and took males more time to clean. Taken together, these results suggest that females are able to assess visually the difference between potential partners differing in their soiling level. If grooming activity is costly, females could base their choice on the coloration of plumage areas more susceptible to soiling and difficult to clean.

	abstract = {P{\textgreater} Melanin is a ubiquitous pigment in the animal kingdom and has been reported to increase biological tissue strength. Melanin is responsible for many observed cases of colour polymorphism, or existence of two or more distinct plumage colours in one species (regardless of age, sex, or mass). Researchers have postulated that the relative concentration of melanin pigments deposited in feathers may function to strengthen feathers but colour polymorphic species have been ignored. Here, we investigate whether different morphs of a polymorphic bird species exhibit differential plumage strength. While colour polymorphism is widespread in birds, there is no consensus on the adaptive significance of polymorphism or the maintenance of clinal variation in colour morphs. The eastern screech owl (Megascops asio) is a polymorphic species; individuals exhibit rufous, intermediate, or grey coloration that is likely caused by relative amounts or concentration of black or rufous melanin subtype (eumelanin and pheomelanin respectively). This species exhibits clinal variation in morph prevalence; the rufous morph predominates in humid deciduous forests while the grey morph is more common in dry or cold environments. Here, we test the hypothesis that differences in feather strength may select for darker plumage in drier climates. First, we use reflectance spectrometry to objectively verify differences in colour morphs of the eastern screech owl. Second, we measure mechanical variables and morphology of dorsal feather barbs. While reflectance spectrometry objectively separated the three colour morphs, we found no significant differences in the mechanical variables of plumage morphs. These results fail to demonstrate differences in plumage strength among eastern screech owl colour variants. This conclusion rejects the hypothesis that melanin subtype affects the strength of body contour feathers in the eastern screech owl and may not factor in the maintenance of the observed clinal variation.},

	abstract = {Pupae of the painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui exhibit pupal color polyphenism consisting of white, dark and intermediate types. We investigated environmental factors affecting pupal coloration and the physiological mechanisms underlying the control of pupal color polyphenism in this species. Over 80\% of larvae reared at 16 degrees C developed into pupae of dark types, whereas over 82\% of larvae at 32 degrees C developed into pupae of white types irrespective of long/short-day photoperiod conditions. When mature larvae reared at 32 degrees C were ligatured between thoracic and abdominal parts at three different pharate pupal stages, all of the head-thoracic parts developed into white pupae regardless of pupal stage, but all abdominal parts ligatured at the early pharate pupal stage only developed into dark pupae. These results indicate that temperature during larval stages is an important element affecting pupal coloration as an environmental cue in V. cardui, and that a factor(s) inducing white pupae is released from head-thoracic parts under conditions of high temperature. Additionally, when ligatured abdomens destined to develop into dark pupae were treated with crude extracts prepared from the central nervous system, all of the ligatured abdomens developed into white pupae at a level dependent on dose and pupal stage. These results suggest that the factor inducing white pupae is a key molecule controlling pupal color polyphenism in V. cardui. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement refers to the evolution of increased mating discrimination against heterospecific individuals in zones of geographic overlap and can be considered a final stage in the speciation process. One the factors that may affect reinforcement is the degree to which hybrid matings result in the permanent loss of genes from a species' gene pool. Matings between females of Drosophila subquinaria and males of D. recens result in high levels of offspring mortality, due to interspecific cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by Wolbachia infection of D. recens. Such hybrid inviability is not manifested in matings between D. recens females and D. subquinaria males. Here we ask whether the asymmetrical hybrid inviability is associated with a corresponding asymmetry in the level of reinforcement. The geographic ranges of D. recens and D. subquinaria were found to overlap across a broad belt of boreal forest in central Canada. Females of D. subquinaria from the zone of sympatry exhibit much stronger levels of discrimination against males of D. recens than do females from allopatric populations. In contrast, such reproductive character displacement is not evident in D. recens, consistent with the expected effects of unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. Furthermore, there is substantial behavioral isolation within D. subquinaria, because females from populations sympatric with D. recens discriminate against allopatric conspecific males, whereas females from populations allopatric with D. recens show no discrimination against any conspecific males. Patterns of general genetic differentiation among populations are not consistent with patterns of behavioral discrimination, which suggests that the behavioral isolation within D. subquinaria results from selection against mating with Wolbachia-infected D. recens. Interspecific cytoplasmic incompatibility may contribute not only to post-mating isolation, an effect already widely recognized, but also to reinforcement, particularly in the uninfected species. The resulting reproductive character displacement not only increases behavioral isolation from the Wolbachia-infected species, but may also lead to behavioral isolation between populations of the uninfected species. Given the widespread occurrence of Wolbachia among insects, it thus appears that there are multiple ways by which these endosymbionts may directly and indirectly contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation.},

We tested between these alternatives for two colour morphs of the coral reef fish, Pseudochromis fuscus, from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). A molecular analysis using {mtDNA} did not detect any genetic differentiation between co-occurring 'yellow' and 'brown' colour morphs. A previous study proposed that these two colour morphs are aggressive mimics of yellow and brown damselfishes. Here, a manipulative field experiment was used to evaluate whether the colour dimorphism in P. fuscus is a phenotypic response to the presence of two different model species. Colonies of either yellow or brown damselfish species were established on different patch reefs, and each of the two different P. fuscus morphs was then placed on the different reefs. Contrary to expectations, all yellow individuals that stayed on the reefs changed to brown, regardless of the model species. No brown individuals changed to the yellow colouration. However, P. fuscus were more likely to emigrate from, or suffer higher mortality on, patch reefs where they were not matched with similarly coloured models. Clearly, yellow and brown P. fuscus are members of a single species with sufficient phenotypic plasticity to switch from yellow to brown colouration.},

A generic template of photopigment absorption spectra was fit to the resulting action spectra in order to establish the maximum absorption wavelength, the A2-based photopigment contribution and the size of the β-wave of each cone-type. Although in general there is close correspondence between zebrafish cone action- and absorbance spectra, our data suggest that in the case of {MWS}- and {LWS}-cones there is appreciable contribution of A2-based photopigments and that the β-wave for these cones is smaller than expected based on the absorption spectra.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Male field crickets use 2 acoustic signals in the context of mating: a calling song that attracts females from a distance and a courtship song that follows once a female makes physical contact with a male. The function of courtship is unclear because females have already chosen and approached a particular male based on his calling song. Using the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus, we tested whether females evaluate the attractiveness of males based on their courtship song irrespective of other male qualities. In a tournament-style assay, females chose males based on elements of their courtship song and preferred males with longer courtship songs that had a higher duty cycle (more sound per unit time). Courtship song was also highly repeatable not only within a bout but also between days in the presence of different females. Additionally, we manipulated the attractiveness of males to females by surgically silencing males and broadcasting playbacks of artificially constructed courtship songs. When we broadcast a preferred song model during courtship by previously nonpreferred males, females showed greater attraction, and vice versa. Courtship song may be particularly important in systems with satellite males that do not produce long-range signals because it gives females their only opportunity to evaluate potential mates.},

In this article, we investigated the conspicuousness of the aposematic red-and-black firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, by presenting images of natural and digitally manipulated phenotypes in their natural habitat on a computer screen to human predators, and comparing the detection times. We asked whether the natural colour pattern can be made more or less conspicuous by rearranging the spatial distribution of colour elements. Hence, we created a phenotype in which the black colour elements were moved to the body outline to test for a possible disruptive effect. In the black and red manipulations, we removed one of the two colours, creating two uniform colour variants. We found that some of our manipulations increased, but none reduced, the detection time significantly; this indicates that the naturally coloured firebug is highly conspicuous. The detection time varied among backgrounds and there was a significant relationship between detection time and chromatic similarity between the bug and the background for the natural and black phenotypes. Although background colour composition has an important effect on the signal, we argue that the coloration of P. apterus has evolved for high conspicuousness.

Potential sources of inter-individual variation are the total amount of melanins produced but also how biochemical precursors are allocated into the eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigments responsible for black and reddish-brown colours, respectively. In the barn owl (Tyto alba), a eumelanin trait (referred to as 'plumage spottiness') signals immunocompetence towards an artificially administrated antigen and parasite resistance in females, whereas a phaeomelanin trait ('plumage coloration') signals investment in reproduction in males. This raises the question whether plumage coloration and spottiness are expressed independent of each other. To investigate this question, we have studied the genetics of these two plumage traits. Crossfostering experiments showed that, for each trait, phenotypic variation has a strong genetic component, whereas no environmental component could be detected. Plumage coloration is autosomally inherited, as suggested by the similar paternal-to-maternal contribution to offspring coloration. In contrast, plumage spottiness may be sex-linked inherited (in birds, females are heterogametic). That proposition arises from the observation that sons resembled their mother more than their father and that daughters resembled only their father. Despite plumage coloration and spottiness signalling different qualities, these two traits are not inherited independent of each other, darker birds being spottier. This suggests that the extent to which coloration and spottiness are expressed depends on the total amount of melanin produced (with more melanin leading to a both darker and spottier plumage) rather than on differential allocation of melanin into plumage coloration. and spottiness (in such a case, darker birds should have been less spotted). A gene controlling the production of melanin pigments may be located on sex-chromosomes, since the phenotypic correlation between coloration and spottiness was stronger in males than in females.},

The occurrence of perceptible and reliable cues about pupation site color is a necessary condition for the evolution of this adaptation. By comparing the pupal color responses of prepupal larvae blinded by cautery of the stemmata with prepupal larvae cauterized, but not blinded, we show that the larval eyes (stemmata) mediate the pupal color response. Using a similar comparison, we also show that the stemmata are involved in pupation site choice by prepupal larvae. Considered in light of previously published work on the spectral sensitivities of stemmatal photoreceptors, the absorption spectra of green vegetation and the effects of different colored surfaces on pupal color, our results suggest a model for the proximate control of pupal color involving the differential stimulation of green and blue stemmatal photoreceptors.},

A detailed picture of the evolutionary history of these species is beginning to emerge, as the relative importance of forces including demographic changes and natural selection is established. A continuing aim is to characterise levels of genetic diversity in a large number of populations of these species, covering a wide geographic area. We have used collections from five previously un-sampled wild populations of D. melanogaster and two of D. simulans, across three continents. We estimated levels of genetic diversity within, and divergence between, these populations, and looked for evidence of genetic structure both between ancestral and derived populations, and amongst derived populations. We also investigated the prevalence of infection with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. We found that D. melanogaster populations from Sub-Saharan Africa are the most diverse, and that divergence is highest between these and non-Sub-Saharan populations. There is strong evidence for structuring of populations between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world, and some evidence for weak structure amongst derived populations. Populations from Sub-Saharan Africa also differ in the prevalence of Wolbachia infection, with very low levels of infection compared to populations from the rest of the world.},

	abstract = {Australian crab spiders Thomisus spectabilis ambush pollinating insects, such as honeybees (Apis mellifera) on flowers, and can change their body colour between yellow and white. It is traditionally assumed that the spiders change their colour to match the flower colour, thus rendering them cryptic to insect prey. Here, we test this assumption combining state-of-the-art knowledge of bee vision and behavioural experiments.In the field, yellow spiders are only found on yellow daisies (Chrysanthemum frutescens), whereas white spiders are found on yellow and white daisies. These field patterns were confirmed in the laboratory. When given the choice between white and yellow daisies, yellow spiders preferred yellow daisies, whereas white spiders showed only a slight but non-significant preference for white flowers. Thus, T. spectabilis select background colours according to their own body colour. When viewed from a distance, bees use an achromatic signal produced by their green receptors for target detection. Through this visual channel, white spiders on white flowers, and yellow spiders on yellow flowers are virtually undetectable. From a closer distance of a few centimetres, when bees evaluate colour contrast, the combination of spider colour against different flower backgrounds affected the response of honeybees, but not in ways predicted by a classical crypsis/conspicuousness interpretation. Yellow spiders on yellow flowers are not perfectly matched when interpreted through the colour vision of a honeybee. Nevertheless, honeybees showed indifference to the presence of a spider, equally landing on vacant or spider-occupied flowers. Likewise, white spiders are poorly hidden on white flowers, as white spiders reflect ultraviolet light strongly, while white flowers do not. Surprisingly, bees are attracted to this contrast, and significantly more honeybees preferred white flowers occupied by white spiders. White spiders on yellow flowers produce the highest colour contrast and bees again preferred spider-occupied flowers. Yellow spiders on white flowers were the only pairing where bees rejected spider-occupied flowers, especially in cases where the contrast between the two was relatively strong. Thus, T. spectabilis select flower colours adaptively in a way that deceives honeybees, or at least does not deter them.},

As the general tendencies of 1-D and H' values calculated here were similar to those in Ohsawa's paper, there is no need to propose any change to his view. However, these recalculated diversity indices indicated that they are values which are more suitable for use.

We assessed how parents allocated food during the night in relation to a manipulation of ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance of the cere (skin above the beak) of their offspring. Reflectance of the cere shows a marked peak in the {UV} part of the spectrum, and location of the {UV} peak is related to nestling body mass (i.e. heavier nestlings have a {UV} peak at lower wavelengths). We found evidence of parental bias in favour of lighter offspring: {UV}-reduced nestlings gained more weight during the night than their control siblings. This study provides the first experimental evidence of the use of visual cues for parent-offspring communication in a nocturnal bird.},

	abstract = {Background: Patterns of spatial variation in discrete phenotypic traits can be used to draw inferences about the adaptive significance of traits and evolutionary processes, especially when compared to patterns of neutral genetic variation. Population divergence in adaptive traits such as color morphs can be influenced by both local ecology and stochastic factors such as genetic drift or founder events. Here, we use quantitative color measurements of males and females of Skyros wall lizard, Podarcis gaigeae, to demonstrate that this species is polymorphic with respect to throat color, and the morphs form discrete phenotypic clusters with limited overlap between categories. We use divergence in throat color morph frequencies and compare that to neutral genetic variation to infer the evolutionary processes acting on islet-and mainland populations. Results: Geographically close islet-and mainland populations of the Skyros wall lizard exhibit strong divergence in throat color morph frequencies. Population variation in throat color morph frequencies between islets was higher than that between mainland populations, and the effective population sizes on the islets were small (N(e):s {\textless} 100). Population divergence (F({ST})) for throat color morph frequencies fell within the neutral F({ST})-distribution estimated from microsatellite markers, and genetic drift could thus not be rejected as an explanation for the pattern. Moreover, for both comparisons among mainland-mainland population pairs and between mainland-islet population pairs, morph frequency divergence was significantly correlated with neutral divergence, further pointing to some role for genetic drift in divergence also at the phenotypic level of throat color morphs. Conclusions: Genetic drift could not be rejected as an explanation for the pattern of population divergence in morph frequencies. In spite of an expected stabilising selection, throat color frequencies diverged in the islet populations. These results suggest that there is an interaction between selection and genetic drift causing divergence even at a phenotypic level in these small, subdivided populations.},

Electron microscopy reveals that the Apollo rhabdom is tiered. The distal tier is composed exclusively of photoreceptors expressing opsins of ultraviolet or blue-absorbing visual pigments, and the proximal tier consists of photoreceptors expressing opsins of green or red-absorbing visual pigments. This organization is unique because the distal tier of other known butterflies contains two green-sensitive photoreceptors, which probably function in improving spatial and/or motion vision. Interspecific comparison suggests that the Apollo rhabdom retains an ancestral tiered pattern with some modification to enhance its colour vision towards the long-wavelength region of the spectrum.},

	abstract = {Correlated evolution of mate signals and mate preference may be constrained if selection pressures acting on mate preference differ from those acting on mate signals. In particular, opposing selection pressures may act on mate preference and signals when traits have sexual as well as nonsexual functions. In the butterfly Colias philodice eriphyle, divergent selection on wing color across an elevational gradient in response to the thermal environment has led to increasing wing melanization at higher elevations. Wing color is also a long-range signal used by mates in mate searching. We conducted experiments to test whether sexual selection on wing melanization via male mate choice acts in the same direction as natural selection on mate signals due to the thermal environment. We performed controlled mate choice experiments in the field over an elevational range of 1500 meters using decoy butterflies with different melanization levels. Also, we obtained a more direct estimate of the relation between wing color and sexual selection by measuring mating success in wild-caught females. Both our experiments showed that wing melanization is an important determinant of female mating success in C. p. eriphyle. However, a lack of elevational variation in male mate preference prevents coevolution of mate signals and mate preference, as males at all elevations prefer lessmelanized females. We suggest that this apparently maladaptive mate choice may be maintained by differences in detectability between the morphs or by preservation of species recognition.},

For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by‐product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.},

Experimental spiders were given the opportunity to learn that a cricket was hidden behind a block of a particular color. To eliminate the use of other cues, we randomly assigned both block position within the maze, and maze location within the room. For control spiders, no cues predicted the location of prey. We gave spiders two blocks of trials. Each block consisted of four training trials followed by a probe trial in which no prey was present. Trials lasted an hour, and spiders were given one trial per day. Not all spiders were successful in Finding the prey during training trials. In the first probe trial, there was no evidence of learning: there was no effect of treatment, the number of successful training trials, or their interaction on which block the spiders chose first. In the second probe trial, there was a significant interaction between treatment and number of successful training trials: experimental-group spiders with a greater number of successful training trials were more likely to choose the correct block in the probe trial. This study demonstrates that P. princeps can learn the location of prey by color cues alone, a challenging task, and adds to the growing literature on learning in spiders.},

	abstract = {When animals forage or court their behaviors are often constrained by factors such as predation risk. Predator-prey interactions govern the evolution of many behavioral and morphological traits. However, animals with foraging or courtship tightly linked to morphology cannot make quick behavioral adjustments when encountering a dilemma. In this study, we investigate how opposing pressures of maximizing prey intake and minimizing predation risk shape the morphology-associated foraging traits of a sit-and-wait predator. Recently, the conspicuous body colorations of certain orb-weaving spiders have been demonstrated to be attractive to both insect prey and predators. In this study, we performed field manipulations to assess how visual luring signals of such predators trade off opposing pressures of feeding and surviving. We created dummies made of cardboard to test how changing size of conspicuous signal affected attractiveness to prey and predators. Dummies mimicked the coloration pattern and chromatic properties of giant wood spider Nephila pilipes. We found that dummies were similarly attractive to prey and predators as real spiders were. Uniformly yellow colored dummies attracted significantly more prey than those dummies that mimicked the color pattern of N. pilipes. However, such dummies also attracted far more hymenopteran predators. Our findings indicate that current morphology-associated foraging traits of certain animals do not necessarily provide the best feeding performance but reflect a trade-off between opposing pressures of foraging intake and predation risk.},

	abstract = {Mimicry systems can be classified by the nature of fitness benefits obtained by the mimic, namely increased mating opportunities (reproductive), increased foraging potential (aggressive), or reduced predation risk (protective). However, there is increasing evidence that mimicry categories are not mutually exclusive and mimics can obtain benefits from more than 1 category. Here, I provide evidence that an aggressive mimic, the bluestriped fangblenny Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos, also benefits from reduced predation risk by resembling the juvenile cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus, which are thought to be relatively immune from predation due to the mutualistic nature of cleaner–client interactions. Instead of removing ectoparasites from larger reef fish, bluestriped fangblennies approach and attack reef fish removing scales and dermal tissue. Fangblennies can switch between their mimic and nonmimic coloration within 5–10min, depending on whether their model (the cleaner wrasse) is present or absent. I found that mimic fangblennies increased their risk-taking behavior toward potential predators compared with nonmimic fangblennies. Mimics were also more likely to attack other reef fish in the presence of predators compared with nonmimics. Animals should only increase risk-taking behavior when they perceive the threat of predation to be low. Therefore, this study provides important evidence that cleaner coloration provides protection from predation to both cleaner fish and their mimics, and the benefits of aggressive mimicry of cleaner wrasse have to be reevaluated in the light of these data.},

Here we explored whether selection for efficient perception has favored the evolution of nestling color designs that maximizes nestling detectability in variable light environments. Visual models were used to estimate how parents perceive the coloration of mouths, flanges, heads, and breasts of nestlings within their nest in 21 species of European birds. We show that the largest chromatic and achromatic contrasts against the nest background appeared for nestling mouths and flanges, respectively. Nestlings of open-nesting species showed a larger general achromatic contrast with the nest than did nestlings of hole-nesting species. However, nestlings of hole nesters showed a more evident achromatic contrast between flanges and other traits than did nestlings of open nesters. In addition, species with larger clutch sizes showed larger general achromatic contrasts with the nest. Gaping traits of open-nesting species contrasting with the nest background were better perceived under rich light regimes than under poor ones. These findings are consistent with a scenario in which selection for nestling detectability in dark environments has favored the evolution of particular achromatic components of gape coloration but also nestling traits that enhance signal efficacy by maximizing color contrasts within a nestling.},

In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles. We have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance, by reflection, the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side. These glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side, presumably for intraspecific signaling. A few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering, white scales that also enhance the blue/green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side.},

	abstract = {Host selection by herbivorous insects is primarily thought to depend on attraction to olfactory cues emitted from the host species. However, the discrimination of these hosts from non-host species may also arise from the adaptive detection and avoidance of non-host cues, including visual characteristics. Many generalist, conifer-colonising beetles, for example, use characteristic volatiles to identify and discriminate against non-host angiosperm trees such as aspens and birches while flying. These trees also differ in bark reflectance characteristics, which could also mediate host/non-host discrimination by interacting with semiochemicals. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the responses of eight species of polyphagous woodboring beetles to traps which simulated the visual appearance of coniferous hosts (black) and angiosperm non-hosts (white), and which were baited with host or non-host volatiles. As predicted, three species of large woodboring beetle and a woodboring wasp all avoided white, non-host-simulating traps that were baited with attractive kairomones, and preferred black, host-simulating traps. Conversely, three ambrosia beetle species demonstrated weaker visual preferences, possibly because they preferentially colonise fallen hosts that would transmit less accurate visual information. However, the ambrosia beetle Trypodendron lineatum did show a greater preference for host-coloured traps when these released host-associated kairomones in addition to their pheromone, and also avoided white non-host traps, but only when these released non-host volatiles. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that multiple non-host cues could synergistically mediate the adaptive discrimination of hosts and non-hosts. Our results suggest that successful host location by generalists arises from the complex integration of cues in multiple sensory modes, and that foraging herbivores evaluate both hosts and non-hosts during their search.},

A ''mean field'' version of the forest simulation model {SORTIE} is developed in which horizontal spatial heterogeneity is eliminated while vertical structure is retained. The mean-field model maintains only approximately one half the standing crop and looses successional diversity approximately twice as fast as the full spatial model. Data from natural stands support the spatial model. A partial differential equation limit of the mean-field simulator is also derived. The results are set in the context of ongoing efforts to develop models intended to predict the biosphere's response to global change. The importance of processes governing fine-scale spatial heterogeneity implies that biospheric models will agree with nature only ii they are phenomenological (e.g. fitted to data) at large scale, or if spatial scaling rules are discovered that allow one to derive system-level properties from individual-level processes.},

This behaviour has been hypothesized to be beneficial in terms of information sharing and/or anti-predator defence. To better understand the adaptive value of communal roosting, we tested these two hypotheses in field studies. The information-sharing hypothesis was addressed by examining following behaviour of butterflies departing from natural roosts. We found no evidence of roost mates following one another to resources, thus providing no support for this hypothesis. The anti-predator defence hypothesis was tested using avian-indiscriminable Heliconius erato models placed singly and in aggregations at field sites. A significantly higher number of predation attempts were observed on solitary models versus aggregations of models. This relationship between aggregation size and attack rate suggests that communally roosting butterflies enjoy the benefits of both overall decreased attack frequency as well as a prey dilution effect. Communal roosts probably deter predators through collective aposematism in which aggregations of conspicuous, unpalatable prey communicate a more effective repel signal to predators. On the basis of our results, we propose that predation by birds is a key selective pressure maintaining Heliconius communal roosting behaviour.},

	abstract = {Aposematic species exploit the ability of predators to associate, for example, conspicuous colouration with the unprofitability of prey. We tested the importance of colour for avoidance learning, memory and generalisation in wild-caught great tits (Parus major). First, we determined the birds' initial colour preferences for red, yellow, orange and grey artificial prey items. The birds showed some preferences, as they were more willing to eat grey prey as their first choice, but these were not strong preferences. We then trained birds to discriminate red, yellow or variable (red and yellow) signals from grey where colours signalled palatable and unpalatable food. In general, the birds learned the discrimination task equally well, irrespective of which colours signalled unpalatability, and subsequently remembered the distinction between previously palatable and previously unpalatable colours in the memorability test. We did not find strong evidence that variability in the signal affected learning or memory. Our results suggest that, in a task where birds must discriminate between palatable and unpalatable prey, it does not matter which specific colour signals unpalatability, although this might be context-dependent. To study whether training also affects responses to unconditioned stimuli, we included orange prey items in the memorability test. Although orange had been palatable in the initial preference test, the birds ate fewer orange prey items after they had been trained to avoid red, yellow or both colours (variable signal) as unpalatable prey, but did not change their preference when trained that these colourful signals were palatable. This indicates that generalisation occurred more readily after a negative experience than a positive experience, a situation that would potentially allow imperfect mimicry to occur.},

	abstract = {Environmental conditions often vary in space and time, and this may explain variation in the expression of phenotypic traits related to individual quality, such as ornamental coloration. Furthermore, the direction and strength of the relationship between coloured trait expression and individual quality might vary under contrasting conditions. These issues have been explored in adult birds but much less so in nestlings, which are more likely to experience different selective pressures and different physiological trade-offs than adults. Here, we empirically investigated the effects of contrasting breeding and diet conditions on the expression of carotenoid-based colour traits displayed by marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) nestlings. We studied the variation in coloration, body condition, and immune responsiveness of nestlings in four populations over a 5-year period. We characterized spatiotemporal differences in rearing conditions experienced by C.?aeruginosus nestlings in terms of breeding (laying date, clutch size, and number of nestlings hatched and fledged) and diet (percentage of mammal in diet and prey diversity) conditions. We found that breeding conditions influenced the co-variation between coloration and immune responsiveness in female nestlings, and that diet conditions influenced the condition-dependence of nestling coloration in later-hatched nestlings. In addition, breeding conditions influenced nestling body condition and immune responsiveness, whereas diet conditions influenced nestling coloration and body condition. Our study highlights that nestling phenotype (levels of signalling, circulating carotenoids, and immunity) varies both spatially and temporally, and that some of this variation is related to differences in breeding and diet conditions. Moreover, under contrasting conditions, the direction of the relationships between nestling carotenoid-based coloration and nestling quality may also vary. In order to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of colour traits in nestling birds, studies and experiments should ideally be replicated under contrasting rearing conditions.

Coherent scattering causing iridescence is frequently encountered in the dorsal wings or wing tips of male pierids. We investigated the effect of the pterins on wing reflectance by local extraction of the pigments with aqueous ammonia and simultaneous spectrophotometric measurements. The ultraviolet-absorbing leucopterin was extracted prominently from the white Pieris species, and the violet-absorbing xanthopterin and blue-absorbing erythropterin were mainly derived from the yellow- and orangecolored Coliadinae, but they were also extracted from the dorsal wing tips of many male Pierinae. Absorption spectra deduced from wing reflectance spectra distinctly diverge from the absorption spectra of the extracted pigments, which indicate that when embedded in wing scales the pterins differ from those in solution. The evolution of pierid wing coloration is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For the first time, graduate students at Arizona State University brought together these scientists, along with educators and artists, at Iridescence: more than meets the eye', a conference to promote interdisciplinary communication and collaboration in the study of iridescent coloration from all of these perspectives. Here, we summarize the outcomes of this conference, introduce the papers that follow in this special journal issue and briefly review the current status of our understanding of iridescence.},

	abstract = {Prevailing theory contends that aposematic coloration evolves in tandem with toxicity so that the evolution of increased toxicity will accompany the evolution of greater conspicuousness. Although variation in aposematic coloration within single species should be selectively constrained, because individuals varying from a predator-recognized warning signal will incur greater risk of predation, several species of poison-dart frogs display remarkable phenotypic variation. This variation may have evolved to match different levels of toxicity, and these species provide excellent opportunities to examine the evolution of aposematic coloration. Here, I test whether increased conspicuousness in the granular poison-dart frog evolved in tandem with increased toxicity. Contrary to classical predictions, toxicity assays, spectral reflectance measurements, and phylogenetic reconstruction reveal that the less conspicuous color morphs are actually significantly more toxic than the brightest, most conspicuous phenotypes and that the more toxic, less-conspicuous form evolved from a less toxic, more conspicuous ancestor. Through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of toxin profiles, I traced the increase in toxicity in the less-conspicuous populations to an acquisition of specific alkaloids, some of which are proven convulsants. These results challenge the tenet that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity and support the idea that once aposematism has been established in a species, phenotypic variation may evolve from brightness and toxicity becoming decoupled.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity may enable organisms to maximize their fitness in seasonally variable environments. However, in butterflies, seasonal polyphenism is often striking but functionally obscure. This paper addresses the possible adaptive significance of phenotypic variation in the tropical butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.) (Nymphalidae). Plasticity in body size and wing coloration can be elicited in this species under laboratory conditions, however it is not known how this plasticity is expressed in the wild. Moreover, adult H. bolina spend the winter dry season in a reproductive diapause, which allows certain predictions regarding the occurrence of seasonal plasticity. Based on consideration of the requirements of diapausing and directly developing individuals, we predicted that if seasonal plasticity in phenotype were adaptive, then overwintering individuals should be larger and darker than their directly developing counterparts. This prediction was largely - although not entirely - fulfilled. Dry season butterflies were duller and darker than their wet season counterparts (this plasticity was superimposed on a genetic colour polymorphism), however size plasticity varied geographically. Dry season adults were consistently larger than wet season adults in the tropical north, but not in the south. We use these findings to discuss the possible adaptive significance of seasonal variation in the colour and size of this tropical butterfly. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Carotenoids are molecules that birds are not able to synthesize and therefore, must be acquired through their diet. These pigments, besides their function of giving birds red and yellow colouration when deposited in feathers, seem to act as immune-stimulators and antioxidants in the organism. Hence, only the healthiest individuals would be able to express carotenoid-based ornaments to a larger extent without compromising the physiological functions of carotenoids. Various studies have reported that birds infected by parasites are paler than those uninfected, but, to our knowledge, none of them has assessed the possible effect of multiple infections by blood parasites on plumage colour. By comparing the yellow colour in the breast plumage of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, between birds infected by different numbers of blood parasite genera, we found that those birds infected by more than one genus were paler than those parasitized just by one. In addition, we examined the potential role of carotenoid-based plumage colour of blue tits as a long-term indicator of other parameters of health status, such as body condition and immunoglobulin and heat shock protein ({HSP}) levels. Our results indicate that more brightly coloured birds had lower {HSP}70 levels than paler birds, but we did not find any significant association between colour and body condition or immunoglobulin levels. In addition, we found a positive significant association between Haemoproteus density of infection and {HSP}60 levels. Overall, these results support the role of carotenoid-based colours as indicators of health status in blue tits and show detrimental effects of parasitism on this character.},

Many butterflies exhibit bright and iridescent colour signals that arise from a characteristic ‘ridge-lamellar’ scale surface nanoarchitecture. Although there are multiple axes of functional variation in these traits, few have been investigated. Here we present evidence that sexual dimorphism in the expression of a sexually homologous ridge-lamellar trait (iridescent ultraviolet) is mediated by sex differences in the density of lamellar-bearing scale ridges. This trait – ridge density – has also been causally related to iridescent signal variation in other coliadines (e.g. C. eurytheme), which suggests that it may offer a common basis to both intra- and intersexual differences in ultraviolet wing reflectance among these butterflies.},

The spots are concave pits with intricate patterns of structural-coloured scales, consisting of large domains of three-dimensional photonic crystals that have a diamond-type structure. Reflectance spectra measured from individual scale domains perfectly match model spectra, calculated with anatomical data and finite-difference time-domain methods. The reflections of single domains are extremely directional (observed with a point source less than 5°), but the special arrangement of the scales in the concave pits significantly broadens the angular distribution of the reflections. The resulting virtually angle-independent green coloration of the weevil closely approximates the colour of a foliaceous background. While the close-distance colourful shininess of E. imperialis may facilitate intersexual recognition, the diffuse green reflectance of the elytra when seen at long-distance provides cryptic camouflage.},

Only 11 snake species have demonstrated physiological color change, although anecdotal reports suggest it may be present in additional species. We describe color variation and physiological color change in island and mainland populations of Boa constrictor using full-spectrum reflectance spectrometry. We employed principal components analysis ({PCA}) summarizing the spectrometry data into two axes that describe the brightness ({PC}1) and chroma or relative intensity of particular wavelengths ({PC}2). Boas from island and mainland localities exhibited physiological color change, and this change occurred on a diel cycle. Boas from both locations were lighter at night and darker during the day. The magnitude of the color change differed between our two {PC} axes. Although change in brightness was similar for boas on the islands and the mainland, the change in chroma was greater in boas from the mainland. Color also varied seasonally; boas were lighter in color and reflected more long-wavelength light during the wet season than during the dry season in Belize. We suggest that a fundamental hormone cycle (melatonin/melanophore stimulating hormone, {MSH}) present in a wide variety of vertebrates, underlies the physiological color change in snakes. If this is true, color change may be more widespread than previously realized, and the perceptual bias of the human vision system may have caused researchers to discount its presence in snakes.},

	abstract = {Food color can be indicative of specific nutrients, and thus discrimination based on color can be a valuable foraging behavior. Several bird and fish species with carotenoid-based body ornamentation show color preferences for presumably carotenoid-rich red and orange foods. However, little is known within species about whether or not individuals with (or growing) more colorful ornaments show stronger food-color preferences than those with drabber coloration. Here, we examine food color preferences in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) - a species with sexually dichromatic and selected carotenoid coloration - as a function of sex and plumage coloration during molt. We captured wild, molting juvenile house finches over 4 wk in late summer/early fall, quantified the color and size of plumage ornaments being developed in males, and determined food color preference in captivity by presenting individuals with dyed sunflower chips (red, orange, yellow, and green). On average, finches showed an aversion to yellow-dyed chips and a preference for red- and green-colored chips. We found no significant difference between male and female preferences for specific food colors, and food color preference was not significantly related to male plumage ornamentation. However, we did find that redder birds demonstrated a higher degree of food selectivity, measured as the proportion of their preferred food color consumed. These results suggest that food color is not a major factor determining food choice in molting house finches, but that there still may be aspects of foraging behavior that are linked to the development of colorful plumage.},

A number of observations suggest that pollinators preferentially visit larger floral displays although the benefit of this to either the plant or the pollinator is not always clear. We use a standard dual-choice experimental protocol to show that honeybees display a receiver bias for exaggerated size and colour contrast two important components of floral signals even when such signals do not indicate quality.

	abstract = {Short-term variations in rates of taxonomic extinction and origination in the fossil record may be the result of true changes in rates of turnover, variable rates of fossil preservation, or some combination of the two. Here, positive extinction and origination rate excursions among Phanerozoic marine animal genera are reexpressed in terms of the amount of normal, background time they represent. In addition to providing a background-adjusted calibration of rate intensities, this reexpression determines the durations of sampling gaps that would be required to explain entirely all observed rate excursions as sampling artifacts. This possibility is explored by analyzing a new compilation of the timing and duration of sedimentary hiatuses in North America. Hiatuses spanning more than approximately one million years (Myr) in the marine sedimentary rock record have a mean duration of 73 Myr. There are two major hiatus types-those that form in response to long-duration tectonic cycles and that bound the major Sloss-scale sequences (mean duration 200 Myr), and those that form in response to shorter-duration changes in sediment accommodation space and that occur within major Sloss-scale sequences (mean duration less than 23 Myr). The latter are approximately exponentially distributed and have a mean duration that is comparable to the mean duration of intervening sedimentary rock packages. Although sedimentary hiatuses are generally long enough in duration to accommodate the hypothesis that short-term variations in rates of genus origination and extinction are artifacts of sampling failures at major unconformities ("Unconformity Bias" hypothesis), the observed evolutionary rates are not correlated with hiatus durations. Moreover, hiatuses that follow the major mass extinctions are not long in comparison to most other non-mass extinction intervals. These results do not support the hypothesis that hiatuses at major unconformities alone have artificially clustered genus first and last occurrences, thereby causing many of the documented statistical similarities between the temporal structure of the sedimentary rock record and macroevolutionary patterns. Instead, environmental changes related to the expansion and contraction of marine environments may have been the primary forcers of both biological turnover and the spatio-temporal pattern of sediment accumulation. Fully testing this "Common Cause" hypothesis requires quantifying and overcoming lingering taxonomic, biostratigraphic, facies, and numerous other biases that are both inherent in geologic data and imposed by imperfect knowledge of the fossil record.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that structural plumage coloration can indicate male quality and is used in female mate choice decisions. Whether or not structural coloration functions as a signal in male-male competitive interactions, however, has not been studied. Male eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, have brilliant ultraviolet-blue plumage on the head, back, wings and tail that is correlated with both reproductive effort and reproductive success. Bluebirds cannot excavate their own nest cavities, and as a consequence of limited nest sites, often engage in intense competition for nestboxes. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that structural coloration reflects male competitive ability by manipulating the number of available nestboxes. We erected a limited number of nestboxes in early spring and, after birds has established residency in those nestboxes, we added more nestboxes to the study site. We found that the reflective properties of the ultraviolet-blue plumage differed between males that acquired nestboxes early versus late in the spring, indicating that more colourful birds won competitions for access to nest sites. We also found that more colourful males fledged more offspring. These observations support the hypothesis that structural plumage colour is a condition-dependent trait in male eastern bluebirds that could be used to accurately assess the fighting ability of competitors.

	abstract = {Sexual ornaments often consist of several components produced by distinct developmental processes. The complexity of sexual ornaments might be favoured by mate choice of individual components in different environments which ultimately results in weak interrelationships (integration) among the developmental processes that produce these components. At the same time, sexual selection for greater exaggeration of individual components favours their stronger co-dependence on organismal resources. This should ultimately produce stronger condition-mediated integration among ornaments' components in individuals with the most exaggerated ornamentation. Here we distinguish between these two sources of integration by examining the relationship between integration and elaboration of sexual ornamentation in three bird species: two with carotenoid-based sexual ornamentation (the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus and common redpoll, Carduelis flammea) and a species with melanin-based sexual ornamentation (house sparrow, Passer domesticus). We found that integration of components varied with elaboration of carotenoid-based ornamentation but not of melanin ornamentation. In the house finches, integration was the highest in individuals with small ornaments and decreased with ornament elaboration whereas the pattern was the opposite in common redpolls. These results suggest that in these species integration and complexity of carotenoid-based ornamental components are due to shared condition-dependence of distinct developmental pathways, whereas integration and complexity of the melanin ornamentation is due to organismal integration of developmental pathways and is largely condition- and environment-invariant. Thus, functionally, ornamentation of the house sparrows can be considered a single trait, whereas complexity of the house finch and redpoll ornamentation varies with ornament elaboration and individual condition.},

	abstract = {To respond appropriately to communication signals, animals must have the ability to decipher signal meaning. At a basic level, interpreting the difference between territorial and courtship signals can be vital for the survival and reproduction of social animals. Male and female fiddler crabs communicate with claw-waving displays, but the function of these waves remains uncertain. Species differ in the context in which they wave: Some wave during courtship, some during territorial defence and some during both. In this paper, we provide evidence that males of an Australian species of fiddler crab, Uca perplexa, use two different types of claw waving display, lateral and vertical. Lateral waves are employed solely in a courtship context, whilst vertical waves are employed during courtship as well as territorial interactions. Using video recordings, we show that lateral waves were produced spontaneously (broadcast), and their frequency increased only in the presence of female wanderers. Vertical waves were not broadcast but were elicited by male wanderers during agonistic interactions and female wanderers during close range courtship. Male resident U. perplexa were able to discriminate the sex of wandering crabs on the mudflat at distances of 32 cm. During all resident-wanderer interactions, residents attempted to maintain a position directly between the wanderer and the home burrow and orient themselves to face females and to present the major claw towards males. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the multiple use of waving displays in a fiddler crab species.},

We found that both sexes responded and discriminated equally between different colours, with some differences between flowers and discs. In particular, the red was preferred in the disc experiment, mainly by males, but was disregarded by both sexes in the flower experiment, where red was represented by poppy, Papaver rhoeas. This suggests that Hermann's tortoise probably relies on a mixed system of olfactory and visual abilities to detect food in order to optimize the intake of essential nutrients as minerals or carotenoids. Our results demonstrate that the most preferred colour by tortoises was the yellow, which might reflect carotenoid content, and we discuss the potential implications of this finding.},

Depending upon the interaction between predator vision, background and colour pattern parameters, certain morphs may be actively maintained in some conditions and not in others, even with the same predators.

	abstract = {The fossil record of modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) provides no evidence for major extinction or radiation episodes throughout most of the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. However, long-term gradual diversification is difficult to reconcile with the sensitivity of present-day amphibian faunas to rapid ecological changes and the incidence of similar environmental perturbations in the past that have been associated with high turnover rates in other land vertebrates. To provide a comprehensive overview of the history of amphibian diversification, we constructed a phylogenetic timetree based on a multigene data set of 3.75 kb for 171 species. Our analyses reveal several episodes of accelerated amphibian diversification, which do not fit models of gradual lineage accumulation. Global turning points in the phylogenetic and ecological diversification occurred after the end-Permian mass extinction and in the late Cretaceous. Fluctuations in amphibian diversification show strong temporal correlation with turnover rates in amniotes and the rise of angiosperm-dominated forests. Approximately 86\% of modern frog species and {\textgreater} 81\% of salamander species descended from only five ancestral lineages that produced major radiations in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. This proportionally late accumulation of extant lineage diversity contrasts with the long evolutionary history of amphibians but is in line with the Tertiary increase in fossil abundance toward the present.},

	abstract = {Aposematic coloration commonly involves patterns with contrasting colours. The early larva of Parnassius apollo is uniformly black, but the later instars develop two rows of dorsal orange spots. We tested the effect of these orange markings on the conspicuousness of the last-instar larva, by manipulating larval coloration in photographs from a natural habitat and measuring how fast human subjects could discover the larva on a touch screen. In the first experiment we compared the detectability of the natural phenotype with that of manipulated uniformly black and uniformly orange variants at different distances. In the second experiment with another set of photographs we added manipulations involving enlarged and reduced spot sizes. Generally, detection time increased with distance, and decreased with the proportion of orange in the coloration. The uniformly black larvae were surprisingly hard to detect even at the closest distances, suggesting that the young black instar has an efficient camou. age. Furthermore, even a small amount of orange colour increased the conspicuousness of the larva considerably, indicating that the orange markings are costly in terms of detectability. Importantly, as the increase in detection time over distances was larger for the natural coloration than for the orange coloration, we suggest that the natural coloration may involve a distance-dependent switch from conspicuousness to camou. age with increasing distance. Thus, even though the orange markings most probably have a signalling function, the coloration is not maximized for either crypsis or conspicuousness.

	abstract = {There is currently considerable interest in the evolution of parasite manipulations of hosts that facilitate transmission. The classic examples of such adaptive manipulations typically concern trophically transmitted parasites that increase host conspicuousness or in other ways maximize the likelihood of their intermediate host being consumed by the parasite's predatory definitive host, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. However, examples of manipulations not involving trophically transmitted parasites are rare. Here we present evidence of a novel parasite-induced change in host coloration that we suggest acts as a warning signal to deter predators from consuming infected hosts, which would result in termination of the parasite's life cycle. When insect larvae are infected by the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora they become bioluminescent and change to a vivid pink-red colour. We used field trials involving wild European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and showed that infected larvae were rarely handled by these avian predators and, on the rare occasions that infected larvae were handled, they tended to be rejected. Our results suggest that the parasite-induced colour change in the host may act as a visual deterrent or warning signal to avian predators, which may be reinforced by the production of a distasteful chemical that, together, reduce the likelihood of infected prey being consumed. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a parasite-induced host manipulation involving warning coloration, and so broadens the range of examples of this fascinating adaptive behaviour.

Water soluble products were analyzed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}) showing yields of peptide-like compounds characterized by amidine linkages and other molecules consisting of aromatic and non-aromatic alcohols and nitrogenous aromatics. Non-soluble products analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) revealed the presence of a material comparable to tholins whereas the products soluble in water showed the presence of an amphiphilic component. The recovered amounts and the {FTLR} spectra corresponding to heavy mineral oil exposed to simulated experimental conditions including {UVC}-radiations, clearly show no difference relative to initial sample indicating that the decomposition rate of these molecules should be very slow at the time. Therefore, we consider plausible that alkane environments greater than or equal ton-C-18 occurring on the early terrestrial planets could offer several advantages for the synthesis and survival of nitrogenous molecules, particularly towards the end or after the age of the large impacts, such as protection against oxidizing atmospheres, high temperatures generated by greenhouse effects or shock waves and protection against decomposition effects caused by high {WC}-radiations, corona discharges and lightning. Currently, these facts could be happening in other regions of our solar system and in extrasolar planets allowing the formation and accumulation of complex nitrogenous molecules.

	abstract = {Many sexually selected traits are thought to be costly to produce, which ensures that they communicate information honestly to conspecifics. Carotenoid pigmentation is classically considered as a costly sexual signal in. many fish and birds. It is often argued that carotenoid colours are 'condition dependent', with an individual's nutritional or health state directly determining trait expression. However, few studies have investigated precisely how a compromised nutritional state affects an animal's capacity to develop these sexually attractive colours. Here, we studied the effect of food restriction on the ability of mate American goldfinches to physiologically process carotenoids during the period of feather growth. We used high-performance liquid-chromatography to determine the types and amounts of carotenoids circulating in blood during moult as well as in newly grown colourful feathers. We show that nutritional deprivation affects the degree to which male goldfinches transport carotenoids through the bloodstream. Food-restricted males circulated significantly less blood carotenoids than controls. They also incorporated less carotenoids into feathers and grew less colourful plumage, but the decrease in plumage carotenoids did not significantly exceed the depressed amounts already present in blood. These results suggest that the means by which these yellow-coloured passerines either extract carotenoids from food (e.g. via lipoidal micelles) or transport them through blood (e.g. via lipoproteins) are more sensitive to changes in nutritional/energy state than are the mechanisms for metabolizing dietary pigments or depositing metabolites into feathers.

	abstract = {While male mate choice behaviour has been reported in many taxa, little is known about its plasticity and evolutionary consequences. In the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, females exhibit colour dimorphism (gynomorph and andromorph). The body colour of gynomorphs changed ontogenetically in accordance with sexual maturation, while little change occurred in andromorphs. To test the male mate choice between sexually immature and mature females of both morphs, binary choice experiments were conducted. Virgin males that were reared separately from females after emergence did not show significant preference between sexually immature and mature females for both morphs, indicating that virgin males were unable to discriminate female reproductive status. On the other hand, males that had experienced copulation with gynomorphs preferred sexually mature gynomorphs to sexually immature ones. However, males that had experienced copulation with andromorphs could not discriminate between sexually immature and mature andromorphs, probably due to the absence of significant ontogenetic change in their thoracic colour. Therefore, female body colour is an important cue for males in discriminating between sexual maturation stages. Learned mate discrimination depending on copulation experience might help males to detect potential mates effectively and avoid sexually unreceptive immature female. We finally discuss the adaptive significance of the ontogenetic colour change in females.},

Even more controversy surrounds the hypothesis of periodicity in the fossil record, with conflicting views still being published in the scientific literature, often even based on the same state-of-the- art datasets. From an empirical point of view, limitations of the currently available data on extinctions and possible causes remain an important issue. From a theoretical point of view, it is likely that a focus on single extinction causes and strong periodic forcings has strongly contributed to this controversy. Here I show that if there is a periodic extinction signal at all, it is much more likely to result from a combination of a comparatively weak periodic cause and various random factors. Tests of this unified model of mass extinctions on the available data show that the model is formally better than a model with random extinction causes only. However, the contribution of the periodic component is small compared to factors such as impacts or volcanic eruptions.},

	abstract = {Complex three-dimensional biophotonic nanostructures produce the vivid structural colors of many butterfly wing scales, but their exact nanoscale organization is uncertain. We used small angle X-ray scattering ({SAXS}) on single scales to characterize the 3D photonic nanostructures of five butterfly species from two families (Papilionidae, Lycaenidae). We identify these chitin and air nanostructures as single network gyroid (I4132) photonic crystals. We describe their optical function from {SAXS} data and photonic band-gap modeling. Butterflies apparently grow these gyroid nanostructures by exploiting the self-organizing physical dynamics of biological lipid-bilayer membranes. These butterfly photonic nanostructures initially develop within scale cells as a core-shell double gyroid (Ia3d), as seen in block-copolymer systems, with a pentacontinuous volume comprised of extracellular space, cell plasma membrane, cellular cytoplasm, smooth endoplasmic reticulum ({SER}) membrane, and intra-{SER} lumen. This double gyroid nanostructure is subsequently transformed into a single gyroid network through the deposition of chitin in the extracellular space and the degeneration of the rest of the cell. The butterflies develop the thermodynamically favored double gyroid precursors as a route to the optically more efficient single gyroid nanostructures. Current approaches to photonic crystal engineering also aim to produce single gyroid motifs. The biologically derived photonic nanostructures characterized here may offer a convenient template for producing optical devices based on biomimicry or direct dielectric infiltration.},

In this study we explored animal color signaling in both diurnal and nocturnal contexts to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of its function. We quantified how the brightly colored giant wood spiders Nephila pilipes are viewed by nocturnal insects, and performed field manipulations to assess the function of a spider's coloration in both diurnal and nocturnal conditions. Seen through the eyes of moths, the conspicuous body parts of spiders are quite distinctive from the vegetation background. The presence of N. pilipes significantly increased the diurnal as well as the nocturnal prey interception rates of their webs, but these rates were significantly reduced when the conspicuous color signals of N. pilipes were altered by black paint. A comparison of the diurnal and nocturnal hunting performances of spiders showed that their conspicuous coloration had a higher luring effect under dim light conditions. These results demonstrate that the conspicuous body coloration of N. pilipes functions as a visual lure to attract both diurnal and nocturnal prey. It seems that nocturnal insects are the major target of this colorful sit-and-wait predator. We suggest that the selection pressure to effectively exploit the color vision of nocturnal prey could be one of the major forces driving the evolution of spider coloration.},

To test the hypothesis that spring environmental conditions (i.e., temperature and rainfall) may affect bird egg pigmentation, we measured by spectrophotometry and photography egg coloration and spottiness on reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus L.) clutches parasitized by the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus L.) collected over a period of 24 years and preserved in the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark. In addition, we investigated whether spring environmental conditions may influence the coevolutionary relationship between the cuckoo and its host via changes in cuckoo-host egg matching. Generalized mixed models revealed that reed warbler eggs were more brilliant in those springs with a higher rainfall and tended to be bluer and greener in springs with a lower relative temperature. On the other hand, cuckoo eggs were bluer and greener in springs with a higher rainfall. Cuckoo-host egg matching in blue-greenness and spottiness was better in springs with a higher rainfall. These results provide support for the existence of an environmental component on bird egg coloration and suggest that environmental factors may potentially affect the outcome of important features of the arms race between cuckoos and reed warblers.},

Some others nutrients like vitamin A may also enhance health and colouration, but these have rarely been tested alongside carotenoids in colourful birds. Here, we examined whether beak colour of the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) reflected circulating levels of carotenoids and/or vitamin A (retinol). Spotless starlings are polygynous, sexually dimorphic birds (i.e. length of chest feathers). The tip of the beaks of male and female spotless starlings is more intensely coloured at the beginning of the breeding season and becomes dull after mating, which may suggest a sexual function. We found that females have a more intensely coloured beak and higher plasma carotenoid concentration than males during mating, and, despite the finding that carotenoid and vitamin A levels were not significantly related; colour intensity was positively correlated with plasma concentration of carotenoids and vitamin A in both sexes. However, adult beak coloration was not associated with carotenoid and vitamin A concentrations after nestlings were hatched. Therefore, beak colouration of spotless starlings provides information about circulating levels of carotenoids and vitamins during the mating season and may potentially function as a reliable signal of physiological status in the context of sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Male-killing endosymbionts have been widely reported in the invertebrates and are highly prevalent in the Coccinellidae. The presence of male-killers can lead to extreme bias in host population sex ratios and may have important and far-reaching consequences for the life-history and evolution of their hosts. Male-killers may have direct and indirect effects on host fitness and reproductive behaviour, as well as affecting the host genome, either via strong selection pressure imposed by highly female-biased population sex ratios or by selective sweeps caused as a male-killer conferring an advantage to infected individuals spreads through a population. Criteria used to predict which species are liable to male-killer invasion, based on a variety of ecological factors, have been produced. In summary male-killers are predicted to occur in aphidophageous species, that lay eggs in clutches, show sibling egg consumption and are liable to neonatal larval mortality due to starvation. We assayed 30 species of Coccinellid for the presence of such male-killers to assess the predictive accuracy of the criteria. Male-killers were identified in 8 species in which they were predicted to occur and were absent from all 10 species predicted not to harbor them. Analysis of the remaining 12 species, where male-killers were predicted by the original criteria, but where they were not found, allowed us to identify areas where the criteria can be refined and improved. We conclude that whilst the original criteria give a reasonably accurate prediction, there are refinements and improvements, concerning details of host diet and life-history, which make them more robust, especially in the light of discoveries of male-killing suppressors and when incorporated give a better fit to our findings from field samples.},

Contrast with the background may accentuate the signal's costliness and make the male more conspicuous to predators. Both effects should contribute to increase male attractiveness. It is therefore conceivable that the extent to which the male plumage contrasts against the background modifies female choice behavior as it improves the discrimination of mates. We tested this hypothesis in domesticated canaries (Serinus canaria ). In the first experiment, yellow females could choose between two yellow males presented in front of a yellow and a white background, respectively. In the second experiment we replaced the yellow males with white ones. In experiment 1 females associated significantly more with yellow males which contrasted strongly against the white background. In experiment 2 there was at least a trend for preferred associations with the white male in front of the yellow background. We found no support that male properties per se were chosen. We could further clarify that females associated with the contrasting male and not with a particular background color. Thus, our study demonstrates that not only inherent properties of the sender but also the interaction of bird color with the signaling environment may influence mate choice.},

	abstract = {Conspicuousness is an important feature of warning coloration. One hypothesis for its function is that it increases signal efficacy by facilitating avoidance learning. An alternative, based on the handicap hypothesis, suggests that the degree of conspicuousness holds information directly about the quality of the prey, and that predators associate and learn about the conspicuousness of the coloration, and not the actual colour pattern. We studied the relative importance of signal contrast and the colours of signals for predator attention during discrimination. We used young chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as predators and small blue or red paper cones on either matching or contrasting paper backgrounds as stimuli associated with palatable or unpalatable chick crumbs. In four treatment groups, birds could use either cone and/or background colour, cone colour only, background colour only or cone-to-background contrast as cues for discrimination. Only birds in the contrast treatment failed to learn their discrimination task. Birds that had a choice between cone and background colour as cues used the cone colour and they learned the task faster than did birds that had to use background colour as a cue. The results suggest that birds primarily attend to the colours of signals and disregard contrast in discrimination tasks; they thus fail to support a handicap function of conspicuous aposematic coloration.

	abstract = {Sexual selection is thought to be opposed by natural selection such that ornamental traits express a balance between these two antagonistic influences. Phenotypic variation among populations may indicate local shifts in this balance, or that different stable 'solutions' are possible, but testing these alternatives presents a major challenge. In the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a small freshwater fish with male-limited ornamental coloration, these issues can be addressed by transplanting fish among sites of varying predation pressure, thus effectively manipulating the strength and nature of natural selection. Here, we contrast the evolutionary outcome of two such introductions conducted in the Trinidadian El Cedro and Aripo Rivers. We use sophisticated colour appraisal methods that account for full spectrum colour variation and which incorporate the very latest visual sensitivity data for guppies and their predators. Our data indicate that ornamentation evolved along different trajectories: whereas Aripo males evolved more numerous and/or larger orange, black and iridescent markings, El Cedro males only evolved more extensive and brighter iridescence. Examination of the El Cedro experiment also revealed little or no ornamental evolution at the control site over 29 years, which contrasts markedly with the rapid (approx. 2-3 years) changes reported for introduction populations. Finally, whole colour-pattern analysis suggested that the greatest visual difference between El Cedro introduction and control fish would be perceived by the two most salient viewers: guppies and the putatively dangerous predator Crenicichla alta. We discuss whether and how these evolutionary trajectories may result from founder effects, population-specific mate preferences and/or sensory drive.},

	abstract = {The American black bear (Ursus americanus) experienced a significant range contraction during the 19th and 20th centuries due to a variety of anthropogenic factors. Although previous molecular studies of black bears provided insight into historic and contemporary forces shaping phylogeographic patterns, none included black bears from the central part of the species distribution. Understanding the historical aspects of the connectivity and genetic differentiation of black bears in this region is important for proper management and conservation programs, but this understanding is confounded by poorly documented translocation efforts and population expansion. To address these issues, we generated mitochondrial {DNA} sequence data for 409 black bears from 15 populations in North America. Two sampling localities (Manitoba, Canada, and Minnesota) were source populations for translocation into western Arkansas and Louisiana. Major conclusions from our study include: black bears in western Arkansas were affected genetically by the translocation program; eastern Oklahoma has been repopulated by westward expansion of bears from Arkansas with a mixture of translocated bears and remnant individuals; black bears in Louisiana were not affected genetically by the translocation program; black bears in western Texas and northern Mexico dispersed there from the southeastern United States; and bears in White River National Wildlife Refuge (eastern Arkansas) share closer genetic affinities with U. a. luteolus than they do with the widespread U. a. americanus.

	abstract = {Many hosts of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) exhibit egg recognition, and reject parasitic eggs. How do hosts discriminate cuckoo eggs from their own? Hosts might be able to recognize their own eggs using the specific pigment pattern on the outer eggshell surface, which may serve as a cue for recognition. We tested if patterns of egg pigments (spottedness) contain this information by manipulating spot density of great reed warbler eggs (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). We also manipulated the colour of eggs when the original spot pattern remained the same. Spot density (approximately 15-75\%) did not significantly affect rejection rate (8-20\% rejection), but when spots fully covered the eggs, i.e. the eggshell was plain dark brown, rejection rate increased abruptly to 100\%. A loglinear model revealed the significant influence of colour on rejection rates, although there was no interactive effect between spottedness and colour. Our results strongly support the differential use of egg markers in host's egg discrimination, suggesting that spot density has limited importance compared to eggshell colour.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods. Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Data relevant to the evolution of these colors and the properties of melanosomes involved in their generation have been limited. A data set sampling variables of extant avian melanosomes reveals that those forming most iridescent arrays are distinctly narrow. Quantitative comparison of these data with melanosome imprints densely sampled from a previously unknown specimen of the Early Cretaceous feathered Microraptor predicts that its plumage was predominantly iridescent. The capacity for simple iridescent arrays is thus minimally inferred in paravian dinosaurs. This finding and estimation of Microraptor feathering consistent with an ornamental function for the tail suggest a centrality for signaling in early evolution of plumage and feather color.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Coevolutionary arms races between predators and prey can lead to a diverse range of foraging and defense strategies, such as countermeasures between nocturnal insects and echolocating bats. Here, we show how the fine structure of wing scales may help moths by slightly increasing sound absorbance at frequencies typically used in bat echolocation. Using four widespread species of moths and butterflies, we found that moth scales are composed of honeycomb-like hollows similar to sound-absorbing material, but these were absent from butterfly scales. Micro-reverberation chamber experiments revealed that moth wings were more absorbent at the frequencies emitted by many echolocating bats (40–60 {kHz}) than butterfly wings. Furthermore, moth wings lost absorbance at these frequencies when scales were removed, which suggests that some moths have evolved stealth tactics to reduce their conspicuousness to echolocating bats. Although the benefits to moths are relatively small in terms of reducing their target strengths, scales may nonetheless confer survival advantages by reducing the detection distances of moths by bats by 5–6\%.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Figs and fig-pollinating wasp species usually display a highly specific one-to-one association. However, more and more studies have revealed that the "one-to-one" rule has been broken. Co-pollinators have been reported, but we do not yet know how they evolve. They may evolve from insect speciation induced or facilitated by Wolbachia which can manipulate host reproduction and induce reproductive isolation. In addition, Wolbachia can affect host mitochondrial {DNA} evolution, because of the linkage between Wolbachia and associated mitochondrial haplotypes, and thus confound host phylogeny based on {mtDNA}. Previous research has shown that fig wasps have the highest incidence of Wolbachia infection in all insect taxa, and Wolbachia may have great influence on fig wasp biology. Therefore, we look forward to understanding the influence of Wolbachia on mitochondrial {DNA} evolution and speciation in fig wasps. Results: We surveyed 76 pollinator wasp specimens from nine Ficus microcarpa trees each growing at a different location in Hainan and Fujian Provinces, China. We found that all wasps were morphologically identified as Eupristina verticillata, but diverged into three clades with 4.22-5.28\% {mtDNA} divergence and 2.29-20.72\% nuclear gene divergence. We also found very strong concordance between E. verticillata clades and Wolbachia infection status, and the predicted effects of Wolbachia on both {mtDNA} diversity and evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotypes. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the pollinating wasp E. verticillata on F. microcarpa has diverged into three cryptic species, and Wolbachia may have a role in this divergence. The results also indicate that Wolbachia strains infecting E. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial {DNA}.},

The position of the {UV} band (i.e. {UV} hue) of the carapaces of younger (field-collected as subadults and matured as adults in laboratory) males shifted, relative to older (field-collected as adults) males, significantly towards longer wavelengths. Food deprivation significantly decreased the spectral intensity of the abdomen, but not the carapace. Questions concerning the mechanisms by which {UV} ornaments change are highlighted, as are hypotheses concerning the role of condition-dependent {UV} variation in male-male competition and as a criterion used by females when making mate-choice decisions.},

	abstract = {Crypsis and aposematism are two different approaches to predation avoidance. Theoretically, the chosen strategy depends on the prevailing possibilities and constraints to the animal. Consequently, insects often change strategy between life stages, but a switch in strategy within a life stage is quite uncommon. In the Swedish shieldbug, Graphosoma lineatum L. (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), there is a colour change from the pre-hibernating to the post-hibernating adults that alters their protective strategy from effective crypsis to aposematism, although both stages are distasteful to predators. The change in colour occurs as there is a shift of seasons, which alters the environmental background. Here, we investigate whether there is a change in behaviour in G. lineatum connected to the change in colouration and protective strategy. We therefore measured the motion levels in the two different colour forms of G. lineatum, both in the field and in a more controlled laboratory set up. Our result clearly shows that there is a change in behaviour connected to the change in colour. Thus, we found that the cryptic pre-hibernation form has a significantly lower motion level than the aposematic post-hibernation form, which is in line with the fact that motion disrupts crypsis, but not aposematism.},

	abstract = {Feathers are complex integumentary appendages of birds and some other theropod dinosaurs. They are frequently coloured and function in camouflage and display. Previous investigations have concluded that fossil feathers are preserved as carbonized traces composed of feather-degrading bacteria. Here, an investigation of a colour-banded feather from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil revealed that the dark bands are preserved as elongate, oblate carbonaceous bodies 1-2 \{micro\}m long, whereas the light bands retain only relief traces on the rock matrix. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the dark bands preserve a substantial amount of carbon, whereas the light bands show no carbon residue. Comparison of these oblate fossil bodies with the structure of black feathers from a living bird indicates that they are the eumelanin-containing melanosomes. We conclude that most fossil feathers are preserved as melanosomes, and that the distribution of these structures in fossil feathers can preserve the colour pattern in the original feather. The discovery of preserved melanosomes opens up the possibility of interpreting the colour of extinct birds and other dinosaurs.},

	abstract = {Iridescence is produced by coherent scattering of light waves from alternating layers of materials of different refractive indices. In birds, iridescent colours are produced by feather barbules when light is scattered from alternating layers of keratin, melanin and air. The structure and organization of these layers, and hence the appearance of bird species with different types of plumage iridescence, varies extensively. One principal distinction between different types of iridescent colours is whether they are produced by a single pair of layers or by multiple pairs of layers. Multi-layer iridescence, such as that displayed by hummingbirds, has been relatively well characterized, but single-layer iridescence has only recently been modeled successfully. Here we use electron microscopy, spectrometry and thin-film optical modeling to investigate the glossy, ultraviolet-blue iridescent plumage colouration of adult male satin bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus violaceus minor. The flattened barbules of adult males are composed of a superficial keratin layer overlying a melanin layer that is several granules thick. A thin-film model based on the thickness of the keratin layer and its two associated interfaces (air/keratin and keratin/melanin) generates predicted reflectance spectra that closely match measured spectra. In addition, hues predicted from this model are positively correlated with measured hues. As predicted from our thin-film model, measured hues shifted to shorter wavelengths at increasing angles of incidence and reflectance. Moreover, we found that individual variation in barbule nanostructure can predict measured variation in both hue and {UV}-chroma. Thus, we have characterized the microstructure of satin bowerbird barbules, uncovered the mechanisms responsible for producing ultraviolet iridescence in these barbules, and provided the first evidence of a nanostructural basis for individual variation in iridescent plumage colour.},

The potato/tomato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli transmits the bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum', also known as 'Ca. L. psyllaurous', which causes zebra chip disease in solanaceous crops. There have been no studies addressing the effect of the bacterial plant pathogen on the biology of its insect vector. We examined several life-history traits, including 7-day fecundity, hatching percentage, incubation time, nymphal survival percentage, nymphal development time, total development time. and sex-ratio of 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-positive and -negative psyllid isofemale lines on tomato, as well as adult mortality index of 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-positive and -negative insects. The only two life-history traits that differed between the 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-positive and negative psyllid isofemale lines were 7-day fecundity and nymphal survival percentage, which were significantly lower in 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-positive lines. The symbiotic bacteria associated with both psyllid isofemale lines were similar, with the exception of 'Ca. L. solanacearum', which showed 100\% infection in the 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-positive lines and was not detected in the negative psyllid lines. These results suggest that 'Ca. L. solanacearum' has a negative effect on population growth rate of its insect vector on tomato.},

In birds, these phenotypic traits usually involve patches of colored feathers. The benefit to harbor honest signals of male quality is the avoidance of wasteful aggressive interactions. Recent work has shown that ultraviolet ({UV}) plumage reflectance is an important signal used by females during mate choice. Surprisingly, however, the role of {UV} signaling on intrasexual selection has been neglected. In the present study, we aimed to test whether {UV} reflectance of crown feathers was used as a signal of male competitive ability during male-male interactions. Breeding male blue tits (Parus caffuleus ultramarinus) were exposed during the female egg-laying period to blue tit taxidermic mounts with either control or reduced {UV} reflectance of crown feathers. In agreement with the prediction that {UV} reflectance advertises male quality, we found that breeding blue tits behaved less aggressively toward the {UV}-reduced decoy. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence suggesting a role for {LTV} signaling on intrasexual selection.},

	abstract = {Exaggerated male-limited coloration is widespread among butterflies, yet convincing demonstrations of intraspecific mating preferences for signal brightness and/or chromaticity are relatively rare in this group. Here, I couple behavioral experiments involving manipulations of ambient light environments and male reflectance patterns with observation of wild mating patterns to investigate visual mating biases in the large grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). Males in this species possess exaggerated, limited-view ultraviolet ({UV}) iridescence across most of their dorsal wing surface that has putative sexual signaling function. In the first experiment, conducted in small (0.7-m3) cages, individuals were significantly less likely to copulate when the {UV} portion of natural ambient illumination (i.e., 300-400 nm) was strongly reduced. In 2 subsequent experiments, conducted under full-spectrum sunlight in small and large (5 x 6 x 4 m) cages, males with their {UV} signal artificially dulled by 25\% consistently copulated with fewer, and smaller, females than sham-control individuals. Importantly, the manipulated levels of {UV} brightness in these experiments fall well within the naturally occurring bounds of variation in male {UV} reflectance. These findings therefore unanimously support the presence of a {UV} signal-based female bias. In apparent contrast, comparison of 161 in-copula and 188 free-flying males from a high-density field assemblage revealed that copulating males were significantly older and henceforth actually possessed (subtly) less {UV} bright wings. Copulating male {UV} brightness was, however, positively related to the size of their mate, which echoes the experimental findings and may represent a signature of mutual mate choice. I discuss these results in light of the full complexities of the butterfly mating system and the potential signaling value of iridescent coloration in butterflies and animals generally.},

	abstract = {Background: Many butterfly species have been experiencing the northward range expansion and physiological adaptation, probably due to climate warming. Here, we document an extraordinary field case of a species of lycaenid butterfly, Zizeeria maha, for which plastic phenotypes of wing color-patterns were revealed at the population level in the course of range expansion. Furthermore, we examined whether this outbreak of phenotypic changes was able to be reproduced in a laboratory. Results: In the recently expanded northern range margins of this species, more than 10\% of the Z. maha population exhibited characteristic color-pattern modifications on the ventral wings for three years. We physiologically reproduced similar phenotypes by an artificial cold-shock treatment of a normal southern population, and furthermore, we genetically reproduced a similar phenotype after selective breeding of a normal population for ten generations, demonstrating that the cold-shock-induced phenotype was heritable and partially assimilated genetically in the breeding line. Similar genetic process might have occurred in the previous and recent range-margin populations as well. Relatively minor modifications expressed in the tenth generation of the breeding line together with other data suggest a role of founder effect in this field case. Conclusions: Our results support the notion that the outbreak of the modified phenotypes in the recent range-margin population was primed by the revelation of plastic phenotypes in response to temperature stress and by the subsequent genetic process in the previous range-margin population, followed by migration and temporal establishment of genetically unstable founders in the recent range margins. This case presents not only an evolutionary role of phenotypic plasticity in the field but also a novel evolutionary aspect of range expansion at the species level.},

	abstract = {Melanin is a widespread pigment causing variation in skin darkness, with darker phenotypes typically reaching higher equilibrium temperatures than lighter ones. Therefore, selection is expected to favour darker phenotypes in colder environments. In the present study, we show intraspecific variation in pupal (and wing) melanization along an altitudinal gradient in two species of copper butterflies. Both, pupal and wing melanization increased with increasing altitude. Consistent with the thermal melanism hypothesis, darker (high-altitude) pupae reached higher equilibrium temperatures than paler (low-altitude) ones. However, as temperature differences were rather small despite pronounced differences in melanization, we cannot rule out that factors (e.g. ultraviolet protection, disease resistance) other than temperature comprise the principal selective agents. Mechanistically, variation in melanization might be related to variation in hormone titres, as demonstrated by low-altitude pupae showing higher ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone titres compared to high-altitude ones. Furthermore, we report sex differences in wing melanization, with males being darker than females, which is potentially related to a higher flight activity of males.

	abstract = {Variation in visual spectral tuning has evolved in concert with signal colour in some taxa, but there is limited evidence of this pattern in birds. To further investigate this possibility, we compared spectral sensitivity among bowerbird species that occupy different visual habitats and are highly diverged in plumage and decoration colour displays, which are important in mate choice and possibly reproductive isolation. Microspectrophotometry of violet-, short-, medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones revealed no significant interspecific variation in visual pigment peak spectral absorbance values that ranged between 404–410, 454, 503–511 and 558–568 nm, respectively. Mean cut-off wavelength values for C-, Y-, R- and P-type coloured oil droplets were 418–441, 508–523, 558–573 and 412–503 nm, respectively, with values at longer wavelengths in ventral compared with dorsal retina cones. Low ocular media mid-wavelength transmission values (340–352 nm) suggest that bowerbirds may represent a transitional stage in the evolution from the ancestral violet-sensitive- to the derived ultraviolet-sensitive-type short-wavelength-sensitive-1-based visual system found in younger passerine lineages. Sequence data obtained for rod opsin and four cone opsin genes were identical at key tuning sites, except for an interspecific leucine-52-alanine polymorphism in the short-wavelength-sensitive 2 opsin. There was no obvious relationship between relative proportions of cone classes and either visual habitat or display colour. Overall, we detected little interspecific variation in bowerbird spectral sensitivity and no association between sensitivity and display diversity, which is consistent with the general trend among avian taxa.},

Here, we measure how fast biodiversity rebounds after extinctions in general, rather than after individual mass extinctions, by calculating the cross-correlation between extinction and origination rates across the entire Phanerozoic marine fossil record. Our results show that extinction rates are not significantly correlated with contemporaneous origination rates, but instead are correlated with origination rates roughly 10 million years later. This lagged correlation persists when we remove the 'Big Five' major mass extinctions, indicating that recovery times following mass extinctions and background extinctions are similar. Our results suggest that there are intrinsic limits to how quickly global biodiversity can recover after extinction events, regardless of their magnitude. They also imply that today's anthropogenic extinctions will diminish biodiversity for millions of years to come.},

Based on evidence from studies linking different phenotypes to individual behaviours we hypothesize that discrete colour polymorphism can reflect personality. We tested for such a relationship in a social bird, the Gouldian finch, which shows two major head-colour morphs: red and black. Forty birds of differing head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour. Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder); (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4) boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect this to function as a signal in competitive and cooperative (social) contexts.

One species in which the function of plumage ornaments has been assessed is the Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis). Studies of a population breeding in Alabama ({USA}) have established that plumage ornaments signal quality, parental investment, and competitive ability in both sexes. Here we tested the additional hypotheses that (1) Eastern bluebird plumage ornamentation signals nest defense behavior in heterospecific competitive interactions and (2) individual variation in plumage ornamentation reflects underlying differences in circulating hormone levels. We also tested the potential for plumage ornaments to signal individual quality and parental investment in a population breeding in Oklahoma ({USA}). We found that Eastern bluebirds with more ornamented plumage are in better condition, initiate breeding earlier in the season, produce larger clutches, have higher circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, and more ornamented males have lower circulating androgen levels. Plumage coloration was not related to nest defense behavior. Thus, plumage ornamentation may be used by both sexes to assess the physiological condition and parental investment of prospective mates. Experimental manipulations of circulating hormone levels during molt are needed to define the role of hormones in plumage ornamentation.},

	abstract = {Generalization occurs when a conditioned response formed to one stimulus is also elicited by other stimuli which have not been used in the course of conditioning. Here, we studied color generalization in honeybees Apis mellifera trained to two rewarded colors, S-1+ and S-2+. After training, bees were tested with non-rewarded novel stimuli, which lay between the trained stimuli in a honeybee color space (Int) or outside the range defined by the trained stimuli (E (1) and E (2)). We analyzed whether bees interpolated their choice to Int and/or extrapolated it to E-1 and E-2. We compared the performances of the group trained with S-1+ and S-2+ to those of control groups trained only with S-1+ or S-2+. Bees trained with S-1+ and S-2+ responded similarly and highly to all test stimuli. These results do not allow discerning between generalization models based on the presence of interpolation and/or extrapolation. Nevertheless, bee's performance was consistent with a linear summation of the two generalization gradients generated by S-1+ and S-2+, respectively. These gradients were asymmetric because control bees responded to the test stimuli as if these belonged to different similarity classes in spite of the fact that they had similar perceptual distances separating them. Stimuli treated as similar were located in the same half of the color spaces, whereas stimuli treated as different were located in opposite halves. Our results suggest that color categories could exist in honeybees and may underlie the performance of the control groups. Under this assumption, color categories would be also present in simpler nervous systems, and would not require factors such as language to be expressed.},

	abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis proposes that testosterone mediates a trade-off between sexual signalling and immunocompetence in males. Such a trade-off could favour the reliability of sexual signals on the basis that testosterone required for signal expression also promotes immunosuppression. However, the immunosuppressive activity of testosterone has not been convincingly demonstrated. We propose that the optimal solution to the testosterone-mediated trade-off should change with age, explaining ambiguous results in the past. Testosterone and ageing would promote two simultaneous immunosuppressive challenges unaffordable for low-quality males. Oxidative stress, as intimately related to ageing and immunosenescence, could contribute to enhance signal reliability. In this context, traits coloured by carotenoids (yellow-red traits) could play a crucial role due to the immunostimulatory and antioxidant properties of these pigments. Here, old and middle-aged male red-legged partridges were treated with testosterone or manipulated as controls. In the presence of high-testosterone levels, middle-aged males increased both circulating carotenoid levels and colour expression, whereas their cell-mediated immunity was not significantly altered. However, in old males, neither circulating carotenoids nor sexual signalling increased when treated with testosterone, but immunosuppression was detected. The link between testosterone and carotenoids could favour the reliability of sexual signals throughout the life.},

Relationships between pink shrimp and salinity have been determined in both field and laboratory studies. Salinity is directly relevant to restoration because the salinity regimes of South Florida estuaries, critical nursery habitat for the pink shrimp, will be altered by changes in the quantity, timing, and distribution of freshwater in flow planned as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project ({CERP}). Here we suggest performance measures based on pink shrimp density (number per square meter) in the estuaries and propose a restoration assessment and scoring scheme using these performance measures that can readily be communicated to managers, policy makers, and the interested public. The pink shrimp is an appropriate restoration indicator because of its ecological as well as its economic importance and also because scientific interest in pink shrimp in South Florida has produced a wealth of information about the species and relatively long time series of data on both juveniles in estuarine nursery habitats and adults on the fishing grounds. We suggest research needs for improving the pink shrimp performance measure. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, I couple behavioral experiments involving manipulations of ambient light environments and male reflectance patterns with observation of wild mating patterns to investigate visual mating biases in the large grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). Males in this species possess exaggerated, limited-view ultraviolet ({UV}) iridescence across most of their dorsal wing surface that has putative sexual signaling function. In the first experiment, conducted in small (0.7-m(3)) cages, individuals were significantly less likely to copulate when the {UV} portion of natural ambient illumination (i.e., 300-400 nm) was strongly reduced. In 2 subsequent experiments, conducted under full-spectrum sunlight in small and large (5 x 6 x 4 m) cages, males with their {UV} signal artificially dulled by 25\% consistently copulated with fewer, and smaller, females than sham-control individuals. Importantly, the manipulated levels of {UV} brightness in these experiments fall well within the naturally occurring bounds of variation in male {UV} reflectance. These findings therefore unanimously support the presence of a {UV} signal-based female bias. In apparent contrast, comparison of 161 in-copula and 188 free-flying males from a high-density field assemblage revealed that copulating males were significantly older and henceforth actually possessed (subtly) less {UV} bright wings. Copulating male {UV} brightness was, however, positively related to the size of their mate, which echoes the experimental findings and may represent a signature of mutual mate choice. I discuss these results in light of the full complexities of the butterfly mating system and the potential signaling value of iridescent coloration in butterflies and animals generally.},

We examine a key assumption under this hypothesis, i.e. that fruit traits can be used as reliable signals by frugivores. We first test this assumption by looking at whether fruit colour allows birds and primates to distinguish between fruits commonly dispersed by birds or primates. Second, we test whether the colours of fruits dispersed by primates are more contrasting to primates than the colours of bird-dispersed fruits, expected if fruit colour is an adaptation to facilitate the detection by seed dispersers. Third, we test whether fruit colour has converged in unrelated plant species dispersed by similar frugivores. We use vision models based on peak sensitivities of birds' and primates' cone cells. We base our analyses on the visual systems of two types of birds (violet and ultraviolet based) and three types of primates (trichromatic primates from the Old and the New Worlds, and a dichromatic New World monkey). Using a Discriminant Function Analysis, we find that all frugivore groups can reliably discriminate between bird- and primate-dispersed fruits. Fruit colour can be a reliable signal to different seed dispersers. However, the colours of primate-dispersed fruits are less contrasting to primates than those of bird-dispersed fruits. Fruit colour convergence in unrelated plants is independent of phylogeny and can be better explained by disperser type, which supports the hypothesis that frugivores are important in fruit evolution. We discuss adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses that can potentially explain the pattern we found.},

Whether the residual organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites was derived in part from ancient extraterrestrial organisms or was entirely prebiotic in origin remains the topic of lively debate. Clearly, however, impact histories during the early stages of planet development logically point to some type of involvement of this material with respect to life's proliferation, either as a source or substrate.

We then modified the community composition by turning the rewarding inflorescences into unrewarding and adding rewarding inflorescences of a novel flower colour. In the short term, bees trained to similar rather than dissimilar inflorescences experienced higher costs of foraging (decreased foraging speed and accuracy) in the novel community. The colonies differed in their speed-accuracy trade-off. In the longer term, bees adapted their foraging behaviour to the novel community composition by increasingly visiting the novel rewarding inflorescences.},

	abstract = {Cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) allows the intracellular, maternally inherited bacterial symbiont Wolbachia to invade arthropod host populations by inducing infertility in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. The general pattern is consistent with a model of sperm modification, rescued only by egg cytoplasm infected with the same strain of symbiont. The predacious flower bug Orius strigicollis is superinfected with two strains of Wolbachia, {wOus}1 and {wOus}2. Typically, superinfections of {CI} Wolbachia are additive in their effects; superinfected males are incompatible with uninfected and singly infected females. In this study, we created an uninfected line, and lines singly infected with {wOus}1 and {wOus}2 by antibiotic treatment. Then, all possible crosses were conducted among the four lines. The results indicated that while {wOus}2 induces high levels of {CI}, {wOus}1 induces very weak or no {CI}, but can rescue {CI} caused by {wOus}2 to a limited extent. Levels of incompatibility in crosses with superinfected males did not show the expected pattern. In particular, superinfected males caused extremely weak {CI} when mated with either singly infected or uninfected females. An analysis of symbiont densities showed that {wOus}1 densities were significantly higher than {wOus}2 densities in superinfected males, and {wOus}2 densities were lower, but not significantly, in superinfected relative to singly infected males. These data lend qualified support for the hypothesis that {wOus}1 interferes with the ability of {wOus}2 to cause {CI} by suppressing {wOus}2 densities. To our knowledge, this is the first clear case of non-additive {CI} in a natural superinfection. Heredity (2011) 106, 642-648; doi:10.1038/hdy.2010.100; published online 11 August 2010},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are reproductive parasites widespread among arthropods. The most common effect arising from the presence of Wolbachia in a population is Cytoplasmic Incompatibility ({CI}), whereby postmating reproductive isolation occurs in crosses between an infected male and an uninfected female, or when a male is infected with a different strain of Wolbachia to that of the female (bidirectional {CI}). Previous theoretical models have demonstrated that bidirectional {CI} can contribute to the genetic divergence of populations in haploid and diploid organisms. However, haplodiploid organisms were not considered in these models even though they include Nasonia parasitoid wasps - the best example of the implication of Wolbachia in ongoing speciation. Moreover, previous work did not investigate inbreeding mating systems, which are frequently observed in arthropod species.{RESULTS}:We developed a stochastic two-island model which simulated three genetic scenarios, diploidy, haploidy, and haplodiploidy, with two {CI} phenotypes being considered for the latter: (1) male development of female progeny; and (2) mortality of fertilized eggs. We also investigated the effect of varying the proportion of sib mating. In the model each allopatric population was initially fixed for a single allele at a nuclear locus under positive selection and infected with one strain of Wolbachia. Each simulation presupposed that the two populations were fixed for a different allele and a different strain of Wolbachia. The degree of genetic differentiation observed in the locus under selection due to bidirectional {CI} was much lower for the two haplodiploid phenotypes than for either diploids or haploids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sib-mating may compensate for the lower efficiency of bidirectional {CI} in haplodiploids by maintaining genetic divergence.{CONCLUSION}:Our model suggests that maintenance of genetic differentiation facilitated by Wolbachia is more likely to occur in diploids and haploids than in haplodiploids. However, increasing the level of sib-mating may compensate for the weak effect of bidirectional {CI} in haplodiploids. Our work therefore gives a potential explanation for why the haplodiploid Nasonia species, which are infected with bidirectionally incompatible Wolbachia strains and undergo sib-mating, have differentiated genetically and maintained this differentiation without premating isolation.},

Previous studies have shown that male U. ornatus are polymorphic in throat coloration and that morphs differ in behavioral aggression. Our study shows that blue throat morphs use 1.5 more pushups per display than other male color morphs, which suggests that throat color and display behavior act as backup signals for aggression. However, other data support the multiple messages hypothesis, and overall our data do not provide conclusive evidence for any one hypothesis. In addition, we show that body mass is positively related to both {PTD} and percent time moving and this relationship is independent of color morph. We also found that throat area, belly area, bite force, sprint speed, and body condition are unrelated to display behavior. This result highlights at least some discordance between display behavior, ornaments, and performance in U. ornatus and suggests that these traits may be evolving independently.},

	abstract = {Despite the proliferation of studies on the role of nestling mouth colour in parent-offspring communication, there has been very little work regarding the proximate mechanism for mouth pigmentation. Carotenoids, a class of phytochemicals important for immune function and gained by birds only through their diet, also serve as pigments for yellow-orange colours. Carotenoids have been shown to be responsible for the colouration of adult plumage and integuments (e.g. bills, legs, combs of adults of several species), but their role in colouring nestling gapes, and the surrounding fleshy rictal flanges, remains hypothetical. Here, we present direct evidence for the importance of carotenoid availability in determining nestling mouth colouration. In field experiments on Hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a passerine endemic to New Zealand, we experimentally supplemented carotenoids directly to nestlings, and indirectly by provisioning parents, and measured the effect on nestling mouth colouration with spectrometer. We found that increased carotenoid availability in the diet enhanced circulating blood plasma carotenoid concentrations, and that this in turn influenced mouth palate and rictal flange colouration. High carotenoid availability increased saturation of the yellow wavelengths of the spectrum reflected by both the palate and flanges, but reduced the reflectance of ultraviolet ({UV}) wavelengths of the rictal flanges. We suggest that carotenoids influence the appearance of nestling gapes both by increasing pigmentation and as a filter of {UV}-reflecting structures.},

	abstract = {1. The retinae of the principal ({AM}) eyes of jumping spiders contain four layers of receptors, one behind the other with respect to the incident light. The distribution of receptors in each layer has been determined.2. The deepest layers (1 and 2) cover the whole area of the retina, and have the greatest density of receptors. The minimum receptor separation is 1.7 \{micro\}m., or 11 min. visual angle. The more superficial layers (3 and 4) are confined to the central region of the retina.3. In layers 1, 2 and 3 the rhabdomere-containing segments are rod-shaped, and are parallel to the incident light. In layer 4 they are ovoid, and are oriented approximately at right angles to the light.4. At the first optic glomerulus the primary fibres from each receptor layer appear to terminate in separate regions of neuropile.5. The focal lengths, radii of curvature and refractive indices of the lenses of the principal and side eyes have been measured. For the principal eyes, estimates have also been made of the diffraction limit, the depth of focus, and the magnitudes of chromatic and spherical aberration.6. The normal position of the image in the eye was found by ophthalmoscopy. For blue-green light, the best image of distant objects is formed on the next-to-deepest layer (2).7. The deepest layer (1) is conjugate with a plane about 2 cm. in front of the animal for blue-green light, or with infinity for red light, because of the eye's chromatic aberration.8. Two theories are offered to account for the retinal layering. Either the spider uses different layers to examine maximally sharp images of objects at different dis tances; or each layer exploits the sharpest image of distant objects, but for light of different wavelengths.9. Optical considerations indicate that either theory is possible, but the seconds (wavelength) theory is the more probable, because jumping spiders are known to possess colour vision. It predicts that layer 1 receptors contain red-sensitive, layer 2 blue-green sensitive and layer 3 violet-ultraviolet Sensitive pigments.10. The structural peculiarities of the most superficial layer (4), and the fact that it is not conjugate with any plane in front of the animal for any visible wavelength, suggest that it is not resolving an image, but performing some other function. Reasons are given for thinking that this might be the analysis of the pattern of polarization of skylight.},

It has been reported that few silverleafing populations of Bemisia tabaci were positive for Wolbachia, whereas non-silverleafing populations were more likely infected with Wolbachia and all that infect B. tabaci are Wolbachia belonging to supergroup B. However, current detection methods were shown to be not sensitive enough to uncover all infections. Herein, a protocol based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of Wolbachia 16S ribosomal {DNA} is presented. A systematic survey for the prevalence of Wolbachia infection in natural populations of B. tabaci using this method revealed that (1) all populations of B. tabaci tested positive for Wolbachia and the overall infection rate reached 80.5\% (293 positives in 364 tests); (2) both single infection and superinfection existed within individual whiteflies tested; and (3) silverleafing populations of B. tabaci most likely harbored A Wolbachia as single infection, whereas non-silverleafing populations tend to carry B Wolbachia as superinfection. It is clear that the Wolbachia infection pattern is closely related to the genetic races of B. tabaci, and the infection frequencies are apparently much higher than those described previously. This study shows that detection methods can significantly influence estimation of Wolbachia infection. It is supposed that Wolbachia may be acting as a biotic agent promoting rapid differentiation and speciation of B. tabaci. This is the most systematic survey of Wolbachia infection within B. tabaci.},

	abstract = {The co-occurrence of plant species within a community is influenced by local deterministic or neutral processes as well as historical regional processes. Floral trait distributions of co-flowering species that share pollinators may reflect the impact of pollinator preference and constancy on their assembly within local communities. While pollinator sharing may lead to increased visitation rates for species with similar flowers, the receipt of foreign pollen via interspecific pollinator movements can decrease seed set. We investigated the pattern of community flower colour assembly as perceived by native honeybee pollinators within 24 local assemblages of co-flowering Oxalis species within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. To explore the influence of pollinators on trait assembly, we assessed the impact of colour similarity on pollinator choices and the cost of heterospecific pollen receipt. We show that flower colour is significantly clustered within Oxalis communities and that this is not due to historical constraint, as flower colour is evolutionarily labile within Oxalis and communities are randomly structured with respect to phylogeny. Pollinator observations reveal that the likelihood of pollinators switching between co-flowering species is low and increases with flower colour similarity. Interspecific hand pollination significantly reduced seed set in the four Oxalis species we investigated, and all were dependant on pollinators for reproduction. Together these results imply that flower colour similarity carries a potential fitness cost. However, pollinators were highly flower constant, and remained so despite the extreme similarity of flower colour as perceived by honeybees. This suggests that other floral traits facilitate discrimination between similarly coloured species, thereby likely resulting in a low incidence of interspecific pollen transfer ({IPT}). If colour similarity promotes pollinator attraction at the community level, the observed clustering of flower colour within communities might result from indirect facilitative interactions.},

We exposed female guppies to (i) a life-like model of this Trinidadian prawn with orange, green or no spots on the pincers or (ii) a live, novel (non-Trinidadian) crustacean (crayfish), also with spotted pincers. First, we provide evidence that guppies sympatric with the prawn recognized our model as a potential predator. Next, we found that guppies spent more time in the dangerous head region of the model prawn with orange-spotted pincers compared with unspotted pincers. Finally, we show that allopatric, but not sympatric, guppies spent more time in the vicinity of the head of a live crayfish when orange spots were added to its pincers than when brown spots were added. Our results suggest that the orange spots on prawn pincers can act as a sensory lure.},

	abstract = {Most insect groups harbor obligate bacterial symbionts from the alpha-proteobacterial genus Wolbachia. These bacteria alter insect reproduction in ways that enhance their cytoplasmic transmission. One of the most common alterations is cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) - a post-fertilization modification of the paternal genome that renders embryos inviable or unable to complete diploid development in crosses between infected males and uninfected females or infected females harboring a different strain. The parasitic wasp species complex Nasonia ( N. vitripennis, N. longicornis and N. giraulti) harbor at least six different Wolbachia that cause {CI}. Each species have double infections with a representative from both the A and B Wolbachia subgroups. {CI} relationships of the A and B Wolbachia of N. longicornis with those of N. giraulti and N. vitripennis are investigated here. We demonstrate that all pairwise crosses between the divergent A strains are bidirectionally incompatible. We were unable to characterize incompatibility between the B Wolbachia, but we establish that the B strain of N. longicornis induces no or very weak {CI} in comparison to the closely related B strain in N. giraulti that expresses complete {CI}. Taken together with previous studies, we show that independent acquisition of divergent A Wolbachia has resulted in three mutually incompatible strains, whereas codivergence of B Wolbachia in N. longicornis and N. giraulti is associated with differences in {CI} level. Understanding the diversity and evolution of new incompatibility strains will contribute to a fuller understanding of Wolbachia invasion dynamics and Wolbachia-assisted speciation in certain groups of insects.},

By constraining color vision, turbidity interferes with mate choice, relaxes sexual selection, and blocks the mechanism of reproductive isolation.

	abstract = {Variation in genetic-based coloration is widespread among vertebrates, yet the underlying mechanisms explaining this polymorphism maintenance remain poorly known. Gene-by-environment interactions on fitness traits in a fluctuating environment are often invoked to explain the maintenance of such color diversity. According to this hypothesis, variation in coloration could signal alternative life-history strategies to cope with variable environmental conditions. However, empirical studies testing this hypothesis are still rare. Here, we aimed at comparing the variation of body mass maintenance behavior and reproductive traits between differently colored individuals in alternative environments. We exposed differently colored captive feral pigeons to different food conditions and immune challenges and measured their investment in body mass maintenance, egg laying, and offspring quality. Under food restriction, darker eumelanic females had a higher egg production, but darker adults tended to lose more body mass than paler conspecifics. Moreover, offspring reared in food-limited conditions had a higher body mass at fledging when sired by darker biological fathers, suggesting a positive genetic effect of a darker eumelanic coloration in harsh food conditions. In contrast, when food was abundant, pale- and dark-colored females had a similar egg production, but darker adults lost significantly less body mass than paler conspecifics. The immune challenge had no effect on adult body mass maintenance and reproduction. Differently colored individuals may thus display alternative reaction norms to different food conditions, suggesting that eumelanin-based coloration reflects how animals cope with variations in food availability. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of food availability in natural systems may thus play a central role in the evolution of melanin-based coloration in wild animal populations.},

	abstract = {Plumage coloration is an important trait used by birds in mate choice decisions and is often an indicator of social status. The two main types of color-producing mechanisms in feathers are pigment deposition (pigmentary coloration) or the coherent scattering of light reflected from keratin microstructure (structural coloration). External factors acting on the feather surface are also hypothesized to affect structural coloration. Because preening is an energy and time demanding behavior, color variation caused by soiling deposition is generally assumed to strengthen the condition signaling function of plumage coloration. To date, studies using artificial soiling have confirmed those hypotheses. However, information about how natural soiling affects plumage color are still scarce. In this paper, I investigated the effect of natural soiling on structurally-based feather color of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. As a method, I applied mechanical cleaning that functionally mimicked natural preening. Removal of soiling caused a decrease of ultraviolet ({UV}) chroma in males and decrease in brightness in females. According to visual contrast modeling, only changes in brightness should be perceived by birds. Further, more efficient chemical cleaning resulted in a significant increase in brightness in both sexes, presumably due to preen wax removal. These results suggest that the impact of natural feather soiling is not likely to modify structural coloration signaling. One possible explanation is that, under natural conditions, the amount of soil accumulating on feathers is too small to affect coloration. (C) Koninklijke Brill {NV}, Leiden, 2011.},

	abstract = {Plumage colour is classified as pigmentary or structural, depending on whether it is caused by pigments or by feather microstructure. However, recent findings indicate that carotenoid-based plumage colouration also reflects at {LTV}-blue wavelengths and that the underlying structure is related to the reflectance properties of the yellow feathers. Thus, yellow plumage is based on interactions between structural and pigmentary components. This study investigated the relationships among the vegetation structure of breeding territories, both components of plumage colour, T-cell-mediated immune response and body mass of nestling Great Tits Parus major. By using a model of avian visual perception, we found that, while plumage yellowness was associated with mature vegetation, plumage brightness and {UV}-blue reflectance were related to immature habitats in territories. We noted considerable variability in the development of carotenoid-based colour components under different environmental conditions, as plumage yellowness, but not brightness or {UV}-blue reflectance, depends on the availability of carotenoids, which is assumed to be high in mature territories with high food abundance. Territorial features denoting mature territories were also related to high body mass and immune response in nestlings, but none of the colour components were related to these variables of the vegetation structure, suggesting that habitat quality is related to nestling body mass and immune response through mechanisms different from those through which it is related to colour.},

	abstract = {Many animal displays involve colorful ornamental traits that signal an individual's quality as a mate or rival. Brilliant iridescent ornaments are common, but little is currently known about their production cost and signaling value. One potential cost of colorful ornaments is the acquisition of limited dietary resources that may be involved, directly or indirectly, in their production. Protein, the primary component of bird feathers and of many nanostructural components of iridescent traits, is naturally restricted in hummingbird diets (comprised mostly of sugars), suggesting that iridescent coloration may be especially challenging to produce in these animals. In this study, we experimentally investigated the effect of dietary protein availability during molt on iridescent color expression in male Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna). We fed captive birds either a 6\% (high) or a 3\% (low) protein diet and stimulated molt by plucking half the gorget and crown ornaments on each bird as well as the non-ornamental iridescent green tail feathers. We found that birds receiving more protein grew significantly more colorful crown feathers (higher red chroma and redder hue) than those fed the low-protein diet. Diet did not affect gorget coloration, but regrowth of feathers in captivity affected both gorget and crown coloration. Additionally, birds on the high-protein diet grew yellower (higher hue) green tail feathers than birds on the low-protein diet. These results indicate that iridescent ornamental feathers are sensitive to diet quality and may serve as honest signals of nutrition to mates or rivals. Further, because both ornamental and non-ornamental iridescent coloration were affected by conditions during their growth, iridescent color in these birds appears to be generally condition dependent.},

	abstract = {Evolution of diet-derived sexual ornaments-some of the most spectacular and diverse traits in the living world-highlights the gap between modern evolutionary theory and empirical data on the origin and inheritance of complex environment-dependent traits. Specifically, current theory offers little insight into how strong environmental contingency of diet-dependent color biosynthesis and environmental variability in precursor supply can be reconciled with extensive evolutionary elaboration, diversification, and convergence of diet-dependent displays among animal taxa. Moreover, biosynthetic pathways of diet-derived displays combine seemingly irreconcilable robustness, lability, and modularity to facilitate elaboration under variable environmental conditions. Here I show that an ontogenetic decrease in the predictability of an association between organismal and environmental components of color biosynthesis and the corresponding evolutionary transition from short-term epigenetic inheritance of peripheral biosynthetic components to genetic inheritance of the most reliable upstream components link the causes of developmental variation with the causes of inheritance in diet-derived displays. Using carotenoid-based colors as an empirical model, I outline general principles of a testable evolutionary framework of diversification and functional robustness of diet-derived displays, and suggest that such a framework provides insight into the foundational question of evolutionary biology-how to connect causes of within-generation developmental variation with causes of among-generation and among-taxa variation and thus with causes of evolution?.},

Studies show that prey contrast against the background increases the signal efficiency. This has occasionally been extended to also explain the presence of internal patterns. We used domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, to investigate the relative importance for avoidance learning of within-prey pattern contrast and prey contrast against the background. In a series of trials, birds were first trained to avoid artificially made aposematic mealworms that were plain red or red with black stripes, and to discriminate them from palatable brown mealworms, on either a red or a brown background. Second, we investigated how the birds generalized between striped and nonstriped prey. The chicks showed faster avoidance learning when the basic color of the aposematic prey (red) contrasted with the background color (brown). However, there was no similar effect of internal pattern contrast. The generalization test showed a complete generalization between the nonstriped and the striped prey. We conclude that contrasting internal patterns do not necessarily affect predator avoidance learning the same way as shown for prey-to-background contrast in aposematic prey.},

	abstract = {1. Structural coloration is common among animals that produce sexual displays involving motion or ultraviolet reflection. Different sources of colour may provide multicomponent signals that indicate the location, sex, and fitness of a potential mate or rival. We investigated the proximate basis and ultimate function of the wing coloration of the territorial damselfly Megaloprepus caerulatus, which produces a dynamic, high contrast display during flight. The wings of both sexes have blue and white bands, but the location of the white patches are sex specific. 2. Wax filaments produce diffuse, white areas through broadband scattering of wavelengths between 300 and 700 nm. Blue bands reflect wavelengths between 300 and 500 nm (lambda(max) = 398 nm) and shift in hue with viewing angle, the result of thin layer interference produced by layers of cuticle and pigment within the wing membrane. Both wing bands strongly reflect {UV} wavelengths. 3. Both the iridescent {UV}-blue and white wing patches provide high contrast against the vegetation in forest light gaps where mating occurs. Moreover, the iridescent signal oscillates during flight. Angle-dependent {UV}-blue iridescence is periodically extinguished during each wing beat cycle, in contrast to the white areas, which remain bright. 4. Males distinguish potential mates from rivals by the presence of a female's white wing tip. Blackening the white wing bands of males and adding white wing tips to resemble a female elicits a sexual rather than aggressive response from males. Conversely, blackening the white wing tips of females reduces sexual responses. 5. The proportional area of the white wing bands of males is indicative of wing symmetry, correlated with body size, and in turn, territory residency suggesting that it may serve as a signal of male condition during intra- and intersexual interactions. 6. We propose that the flashing iridescent {UV}-blue wing bands provide a beacon to potential mates across forest light gaps, whereas the white patches serve in mate recognition and may indicate male quality or territorial status. Our study identifies a unique combination of interference and broadband reflectors that provide a dynamic multicomponent signal.},

The observed preferences of avian parents for carotenoid-rich mouth colors that advertise good condition has been interpreted as support for this hypothesis. However, because these condition-dependent visual signals might also make offspring more visually conspicuous, active parental preferences for carotenoid-rich traits are difficult to distinguish from passive responses to differences in detectability among offspring. Here, we used a visual model to examine how mouth colors influence the visual conspicuousness of nestling house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to parents under a suite of realistic ambient light conditions. We found little evidence that mouths rich in carotenoids provided more conspicuous targets to parents than mouths poor in carotenoids. While other features of mouth color may have evolved to increase conspicuousness, our results suggest that carotenoid-based coloration is not a product of detectability pressures and rather may serve as a signal of nestling quality.},

We found that tick infestation was higher in males than in females. Males showing relatively heavier body for their tail length (predominantly males with regenerated tails) and relatively thinner tail base experienced higher infestation rates. In turn, relatively heavier females for their snout-vent length were less tick infested. Although some components of throat and chest coloration varied significantly with relative tail length, tail-base thickness, body mass, and head size, a measure of male throat and female chest color saturation seemed independent of lizard morphology. After correcting for the effects of morphology on skin coloration and tick load, the saturation of blue throat color in male lizards decreased with increasing level of tick infestation. In contrast, yellow chest color saturation increased with residual tick numbers in females. Considering presumably different signaling functions of male and female lizard coloration, our work suggests that tick infestation might represent a handicap for Green Lizards.},

	abstract = {Much recent research on ecosystem restoration has focused on specific cases, restoration mechanisms, and techniques in the field. However, there has been less emphasis on the theoretical aspects. Here, species richness is considered as an indicator of ecosystem restoration. The dynamic process of ecosystem restoration is put into a coordinate system consisting of species richness s and time t. The factors affecting ecosystem restoration are introduced into the system to develop dynamic models describing the ecosystem restoration process. We propose that the forces controlling the restoration process include ecosystem restoration force (F (1)), disturbance force (F (2)), environmental resistance force (F (3)), resistance force to disturbance (F (4)), and the resultant force F, and develop models for their calculation. These forces are functions of time, climate, species immigration rate, disturbance, species richness, and soil nutrient heterogeneity. Disturbance force (F (2)) and resistance force to disturbance (F (4)) are positively related to species richness. Our models suggest that the velocity differential psi of the change in species richness is inversely proportional to species richness and directly proportional to the resultant force F of ecosystem restoration. In the presence of a harmful disturbance, species richness is always lower than maximum species richness s (m). The lower the primary richness s (0) and immigration rate r in ecosystem restoration, the more obvious the logistic characteristics of the curve of the dynamic process. The dynamic models can be used to predict the restoration of species richness and analyze its dynamic mechanism, and assess the potential for ecosystem restoration. This integrated approach provides a new understanding of ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are bacteria that live inside the cells of a large number of invertebrate hosts and are transmitted from infected females to their offspring. Their presence is associated with cytoplasmic incompatibility in several species of Drosophila. Cytoplasmic incompatibility results when the sperm of infected males fertilize eggs of uninfected females, causing more or less intense embryonic mortality (unidirectional incompatibility). This phenomenon also appears in crosses between populations infected with different Wolbachia strains (bidirectional incompatibility). The influence of Wolbachia infection on host populations has attracted attention as a potentially rapid mechanism for development of reproductive isolation and subsequent speciation. We examined the influence of this bacterium on reproductive isolation in interspecific crosses between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. We found that Wolbachia infection negatively affected these two species in homospecific crosses. However, in interspecific crosses, it only influenced sexual isolation, as infected females more frequently hybridized than females free of infection; postzygotic reduction of fitness (bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility) was not detected. This would be explained by the existence of several modes of rescue systems in these two species, reducing cytoplasmic incompatibility between them. Wolbachia does not appear to cause reproductive isolation between these two species.},

In a field experiment, we manipulated nestling plumage colouration by a carotenoid-supplementation and analysed the parental food provisioning behaviour before feather appearance and at the end of the nestling stage. Carotenoids per se did not influence the nestlings begging behaviour or parental feeding decisions and we found no evidence that carotenoid-based colouration in nestling great tits has a signalling function in parent-offspring interactions. Parents did not discriminate between intensely coloured and control offspring in their food provisioning and in accordance with this finding intensely coloured nestlings were not heavier or larger at the end of the nestling stage. Alternative explanations for the evolution of carotenoid-based colours in nestling birds are discussed.},

Museum collections have provided a widely used resource because they allow efficient sampling across broad temporal, geographical, and taxonomic ranges, even for species that are rare and for which sampling in the wild is ethically or practically unwarranted. We used reflectance spectrophotometry across the avian visual spectrum to compare eggshell color of specimens of the song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in two museums (Natural History Museum, {UK} and Auckland Museum, New Zealand) with each other and with eggshells collected fresh in New Zealand. These data enabled us to test the effects of source and storage in different museums, as well as time since collection, across four metrics of eggshell coloration: blue-green and ultraviolet chroma, overall brightness, and the spectral coefficient of variation. Variation within an egg, within a clutch, and among clutches, was similar between the two museum datasets but different from those of fresh eggs. We found significant differences in all four metrics between the collections, and that fresh eggshells reflected stronger in the blue-green wavelength than in museum eggs. This difference is most likely due to different preservation techniques and storage histories. Furthermore, an effect of time since collection was only apparent in the blue-green chroma and was higher in more recent museum eggshell samples. Our results support the use of historic museum samples in intraspecific studies of shell coloration providing that efforts are made to compare specimens, which were collected during similar periods.},

However, several studies have demonstrated signalling by means of bright green colouration in Swedish Lacerta agilis males during the breeding season. Unfortunately, most of these studies have been based on human colour perception that differs in several ways from that of lizard. An important difference between human and lizard colour vision is the presence of an ultraviolet ({UV}) sensitive cone in lizards. The available evidence suggests that male sand lizards colorations do not reflect {UV} wavelengths, at least in Swedish populations. However, this study, based on objective (spectrophotometric) measures of Pyrenean L. agilis, revealed a secondary reflectance peak in the {UV} in male green colouration. This secondary peak increases sexual dichromatism and male conspicuousness. Moreover, it could have a social signalling function as do similar {UV} reflecting patches in other lizard species.},

In many species, the brightness of carotenoid-based plumage reflects the health and condition of individuals and is used in mate selection. The information contained in melanin-based and structurally based ornamental colors in birds is less well resolved, however. We subjected male house sparrows Passer domesticus and brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater to stressful nutritional conditions during molt to test the hypothesis that melanin- and structurally based plumage colors are nutritionally condition-dependent. We restricted food access for treatment males during randomized 6h periods on 4 days per week, while allowing control birds access to food ad libitum throughout the course of the molt. We found that the size and brightness of the melanin-based throat badges in male house sparrows were not affected by nutritional stress. Similarly, there were no differences between treatment and control male cowbirds in the size or brightness of the melanin-based brown hood. However, the structurally based iridescent plumage of cowbirds was indicative of the nutritional condition of males during molt. Nutritionally stressed cowbirds grew significantly less colorful plumage than did males with access to food ad libitum. These results are consistent with observations in other avian species that different types of plumage color communicate different sets of information. Melanin ornaments are less sensitive to nutritional conditions during molt and instead may reflect the hormonal status and/or competitive ability of males, whereas structural coloration appears to be an accurate signal of health and condition.},

Larvae of the common blue butterfly Polyommatus icarus specifically sequester flavonoids in different amounts and types, depending on the part or species of food plant. During late pupal development the majority of ultraviolet-absorbing flavonoids are deposited in the wing scales. The flavonoid content of the larval diet thereby determines ultraviolet wing patterns. In laboratory and field experiments, male butterflies clearly preferred flavonoid-rich, ultraviolet-absorbing female dummies. This preference is mediated visually by the ultraviolet pattern of the wings. Food-plant parts and species vary in value as a food source, so ultraviolet wing patterns may signal mate quality and are not a species-specific characteristic. We discuss the use of principal component analysis in analysing spectral data in the context of visual communication. We propose the alternative application of confidence intervals of averaged spectra as a novel straightforward statistical method for comparing groups of spectra in a manner that is independent of assumptions about the visual system of the receiver. In addition, they can be used to give confidence intervals to derived measures of colour such as quantum catch by photoreceptors.},

Here we test the existence of changes in a host's adaptation to brood parasitism in the absence of parasitism by studying intraclutch variation in egg appearance, which is a genetically determined component of host defence favouring discrimination of parasitic eggs. We investigated egg phenotypes of a common host of the European cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, in the presence and in the absence of cuckoos. By using objective spectroradiometry techniques of colour assessment we compared intraclutch variation between populations of meadow pipit, Anthus pratensis, sympatric (England) and allopatric (Iceland and Faeroe Islands) with C. canorus. Allopatric populations of A. pratensis showed greater intraclutch variation in egg appearance in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum than did a population sympatric with C. canorus.

	abstract = {The fundamental dichotomy between incoherent (phase independent) and coherent (phase dependent) light scattering provides the best criterion for a classification of biological structural color production mechanisms. Incoherent scattering includes Rayleigh, Tyndall, and Mie scattering. Coherent scattering encompasses interference, reinforcement, thin-film reflection, and diffraction. There are three main classes of coherently scattering nanostructures--laminar, crystal-like, and quasi-ordered. Laminar and crystal-like nanostructures commonly produce iridescence, which is absent or less conspicuous in quasi-ordered nanostructures. Laminar and crystal-like arrays have been analyzed with methods from thin-film optics and Bragg's Law, respectively, but no traditional methods were available for the analysis of color production by quasi-ordered arrays. We have developed a tool using two-dimensional (2D) Fourier analysis of transmission electron micrographs ({TEMs}) that analyzes the spatial variation in refractive index (available from the authors). This Fourier tool can examine whether light scatterers are spatially independent, and test whether light scattering can be characterized as predominantly incoherent or coherent. The tool also provides a coherent scattering prediction of the back scattering reflectance spectrum of a biological nanostructure. Our applications of the Fourier tool have falsified the century old hypothesis that the non-iridescent structural colors of avian feather barbs and skin are produced by incoherent Rayleigh or Tyndall scattering. 2D Fourier analysis of these quasi-ordered arrays in bird feathers and skin demonstrate that these non-iridescent colors are produced by coherent scattering. No other previous examples of biological structural color production by incoherent scattering have been tested critically with either analysis of scatterer spatial independence or spectrophotometry. The Fourier tool is applied here for the first time to coherent scattering by a laminar array from iridescent bird feather barbules (Nectarinia) to demonstrate the efficacy of the technique on thin films. Unlike previous physical methods, the Fourier tool provides a single method for the analysis of coherent scattering by a diversity of nanostructural classes. This advance will facilitate the study of the evolution of nanostructural classes from one another and the evolution of nanostructure itself. The article concludes with comments on the emerging role of photonics in research on biological structural colors, and the future directions in development of the tool.},

	abstract = {Forests exhibit much variation in light environments, and this can affect communication among animals, communication between animals and plants, photosynthesis, and plant morphogenesis. Light environments are caused by, and can be predicted from, the geometry of the light paths, the weather conditions, and the time of day. The structure of forests leads to four major light habitats when the sun is not blocked by clouds: forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and large gaps. These are characterized by yellow-green, blue-gray, reddish, and ''white'' ambient light spectra, respectively. When the sun is blocked by clouds, the spectra of these four habitats converge on that of large gaps and open areas, so the single light environment during cloudy weather will be called open/cloudy. An additional light environment (early/late) is associated with low sun angles (near dawn or dusk); it is purplish. Each light environment is well defined and was found in forests of Trinidad, Panama, Costa Pica, Australia, California, and Florida. Scattered literature references suggest similar patterns elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Java. Perceived colors of animals, flowers, and fruits depend upon the interaction between ambient light color and the reflectance color of the animal or plant parts. As a result, an animal or plant may have a different appearance in each environment, i.e., a color pattern may be relatively cryptic in some light environments while relatively conspicuous in others. This has strong implications for the joint evolution of visual signals and vision, as well as microhabitat choice. Plant growth and form may also be affected by variation in the color of forest light.},

During the breeding season, male red jungle fowl with large combs, a sexually selected trait, have lower levels of lymphocytes, but greater cell-mediated immunity, indicated by a cutaneous hypersensitivity response. Before the breeding season, however, both cell-mediated immunity and proportion of lymphocytes are positively correlated with comb length. Cell-mediated immunity is particularly important to jungle fowl during the breeding season, because the likelihood of injury during sexual competition is high and cell-mediated immunity is essential for healing wounds and resisting infection. This seasonal change in one aspect of immunity but not another suggests that the birds adaptively maintain certain immune system abilities, and that it can be misleading to use a single aspect of immune response in evaluating immunocompetence.},

We investigated temporal trends in an index of plumage colour of Italian scops owls from museum collections (1870-2007). We found a significant increase in plumage redness over the last century, which was correlated with an increase in temperature and rainfall of the years before specimen collection. However, the temporal increase in plumage redness persisted after controlling for climatic variables, suggesting that other environmental factors could be involved. Our study indicates that ongoing climate changes might have either shifted the selective balance between colour morphs, or differentially affected migration and movement patterns of colour morphs.},

	abstract = {The signaling role of sexual ornaments that are displayed during the mating season is well known for many species, but dimorphisms that occur in the non-breeding season have received much less attention, particularly when individuals only partially express their breeding condition during reproductively inactive periods. I assessed variation in the expression of colorful breeding and non-breeding plumages in male American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis), a species in which males molt out of their colorful breeding ornaments in the fall but still display reduced carotenoid- and melanin-based sexual dichromatism during the winter. I found that variability in the saturation of carotenoid-based plumage pigmentation did not differ significantly between the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Moreover, the area of melanin coloration in the cap was more variable in winter than when it is fully displayed during breeding. I also detected a significant positive correlation between the extent of melanin coloration during the winter and the saturation of non-breeding carotenoid-based plumage. Because of such variation in and correlated expression of these two color ornaments in winter, it is conceivable that male goldfinches display these hints of non-breeding coloration for use as conspecific social or sexual signals. Natural selection pressures like predation and energetic demands are traditionally thought of as factors that restrict sex ornaments to breeding times alone, but this should not preclude animals from simply reducing their exaggerated features during winter and finding an expression optimum that balances signal costs and value. Such 'remnant' winter ornaments might be expected to evolve not only in animals that live in large non-breeding groups (e.g. status-signaling systems) but also in those where mates begin associating before breeding onset.},

Open rings were positioned in front of spiders designated as controls. 2. Early in the rainy season, prey capture was slightly but significantly higher at webs where the visibility of one side of the spider was enhanced (or hidden). Later in the rainy season when insect abundance dropped, more pollinating insects were attracted by the spider's ultraviolet ({UV})-reflecting, dorsal surface than the spider's brown and yellow venter. 3. These data suggest that the coloured and patterned body surfaces of Argiope argentata affect the rate and types of prey spiders capture. The importance of the colour patterns, however, varies with the abundance and type of insects in the area in which the spider is foraging.},

Where it occurs, one female morph typically resembles the conspecific male phenotype, but the degree of resemblance varies across species. Here, we question whether the degree of phenotypic similarity between male-like females and males varies within species. Phenotypic resemblance is hypothesized to depend on the potential for frequency- and density-dependent selection on male and (or) female phenotypes. We studied six populations of the damselfly Nehalennia irene (Hagen, 1861) that differed widely in estimates of morph frequency and male density. Male-like females resemble males more than another female type resembles males, across populations, when comparisons are based on abdominal patterns. Abdomen phenotype does matter in male-female interactions of damselflies. Furthermore, male-like females were more similar to males at low and high density sites compared with sites with intermediate densities, contrary to the hypothesis that the potential for male harassment influences the degree of phenotypic similarity. Additionally, male-like females of most populations converged on the abdominal phenotype of males of one population rather than on that of syntopic males; a problem that has not received any attention.},

Partial amputation of the wings in saturniids decreases wingbeat period. Cutting the sensory nerves from the wings increases the period. These results indicate that the influence of wing movement on wingbeat period is mediated by receptors near the base of the wing.4. The central nervous mechanisms which generate motor patterns during flight in Lepidoptera are discussed and compared with those in locusts.

In this study, the density of white blood cells ({WBC}), carotenoid colors, and length of the same feathers on each wing were measured in breeding great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) on the coast of northern Norway, and related to the blood residues of five {OCs}, including {HCB} (hexachlorobenzene), beta-{HCH} (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane), p,p '-{DDE} (p, p '-dichlorodipheiiyldichloroethylene), oxychlordane, and polychlorinated biphenyl ({PCB}), in addition to Sigma {OC}. Neither, {WBC} density nor carotenoid colors were significantly related to blood residues of any of the {OCs}, suggesting that {OC} levels may have been too low to significantly affect these outcome parameters. However, in the colony where the {OC} concentrations were highest, there was a weak but significantly positive relationship between the probability of having different length of feathers on each wing and levels of {PCB} and Sigma {OC}, in males. Thus varying length of the wing primaries may reflect adverse impacts of {OCs} in great black-backed gulls. However, in gulls with moderate levels of {OCs}, it is probably not a sensitive indicator of progressing ecological impacts of {OCs}, since such adverse ecological relationships were found in the breeding colonies where there were no relationships between differences in wing feather lengths and {OCs}.},

	abstract = {Much of the literature on male–female coevolution concerns the processes by which male traits and female preferences for these can coevolve and be maintained by selection. There has been less explicit focus on the origin of male traits and female preferences. Here, I argue that it is important to distinguish origin from subsequent coevolution and that insights into the origin can help us appreciate the relative roles of various coevolutionary processes for the evolution of diversity in sexual dimorphism. I delineate four distinct scenarios for the origin of male traits and female preferences that build on past contributions, two of which are based on pre-existing variation in quality indicators among males and two on exploitation of pre-existing sensory biases among females. Recent empirical research, and theoretical models, suggest that origin by sensory exploitation has been widespread. I argue that this points to a key, but perhaps transient, role for sexually antagonistic coevolution ({SAC}) in the subsequent evolutionary elaboration of sexual traits, because (i) sensory exploitation is often likely to be initially costly for individuals of the exploited sex and (ii) the subsequent evolution of resistance to sensory exploitation should often be associated with costs due to selective constraints. A review of a few case studies is used to illustrate these points. Empirical data directly relevant to the costs of being sensory exploited and the costs of evolving resistance is largely lacking, and I stress that such data would help determining the general importance of sexual conflict and {SAC} for the evolution of sexual dimorphism.},

Although male-male competition and female mate choice characteristically select for increased color conspicuousness, visibility to predators and to prey often select for decreased conspicuousness. We examined three populations of Common Collared Lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, in Oklahoma (Arcadia Lake, Glass Mountains, Wichita Mountains) that have been argued to differ in the intensity of natural and sexual selection acting on their color patterns. Our study had two main objectives. First, reflectance spectra were obtained from the lizards to replicate and extend previous work on differences in sexual dichromatism among these populations. Second, spectra were gathered on components of visual backgrounds at our study sites to explore the possibility that each population may be relatively cryptic within its own habitat. Results showed that most body regions differed significantly in sexual dichromatism among populations, but in contrast to prior work, no one population was more sexually dichromatic than another for all body regions examined. Males exhibited less overlap in coloration with their visual backgrounds than did females (i.e., males were more conspicuous), and females overlapped more in coloration with rocks than with other visual backgrounds. The population estimated previously to experience the strongest predation pressure (Arcadia Lake) was shown in the present study to be the least conspicuous. Some support also was found for the proposition that even the most "colorful" population (Wichita Mountains) may not always be conspicuous when viewed against its typical visual background.},

	abstract = {Camouflage is one of the most widespread and powerful strategies that animals use to make detection/recognition more difficult. Many orb-web spiders of the genus Cyclosa add prey remains, plant debris, moults, and/or eggsacs to their webs called web decorations. Web decorations resembling spider body colour pattern have been considered to camouflage the spider from predators. While this camouflage is obvious from a human's perspective, it has rarely been investigated from a predator's perspective. In this study, we tested the visibility of web decorations by calculating chromatic and achromatic contrasts of detritus and eggsac decorations built by Cyclosa octotuberculata, against four different backgrounds viewed by both bird (e.g., blue tits) and hymenopteran (e.g. wasps) predators. We showed that both juvenile and adult spiders on webs with detritus or egg-sac decorations were undetectable by both hymenopteran and bird predators over short and long distances. Our results thus suggest that decorating webs with detritus or eggsacs by C. octotuberculata may camouflage the spiders from both hymenopteran and bird predators in their common habitats [Current Zoology 56 (3): 379-387, 2010].},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research on the evolution of avian dichromatism, the anatomical bases for differences between the sexes in species with structurally coloured plumage remain largely unknown. Using full-spectrum spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy, we compared the colour and morphology of rump feathers of male and female eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis). The ultraviolet ({UV})-blue feather colour in this species is caused by coherent scattering of light within the medullary‘spongy layer’ of feather barbs. This spongy layer lies beneath a keratin cortex and on top of a layer of melanin granules that surround a hollow central vacuole. Irregularly shaped electron-dense regions are present within the cortex. Male and {femaleS}. sialisdiffered substantially in their plumage colour and feather structure. A backwards logistic regression predicted sex with 100\% accuracy using the colour variables brightness, {UV}-violet ({UV}-V) chroma and spectral saturation. A second backwards logistical regression predicted sex with 100\% accuracy using relative cortex area and size of air spaces. Thus,S. sialisare dimorphic both in colour and in the structures causing this colour. Multiple regression analyses using data pooled from both sexes indicated that multiple features of feather barb structure contributed to colour variation in complex ways. Brightness was negatively related to the relative surface area of cortex in barb cross-sections. Hue was positively related and {UV}-V chroma was negatively related to the distance between scattering elements (i.e. keratin rods and air spaces) in the spongy layer. In contrast, hue was negatively related and {UV}-V chroma was positively related to the thickness of the spongy layer. {UV}-V chroma was also negatively related to the relative area of electron-dense regions in the cortex. Spectral saturation was negatively related to the distance between scatterers and the standard error of the size of air spaces. These results suggest that the dimensions of spongy-layer elements are critical to colour production, but that {UV}-blue coloration can also be modified by the cortex and the thickness of the spongy layer. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005,84, 259–271.

Distances and neighbor-joining trees on the Kimura 2-parameter measure as well as {BlastN} searches in {GenBank} revealed that the strain of Wolbachia infecting D. lemniscata, D. v virgifera, A blandulum, and A. vittatum are most likely the same strain of Wolbachia within the division A group. The strain of Wolbachia infecting D. cristata also clusters within the A group, but it is different from that found in the other four Diabroticites.

In previous research, captive passion-vine butterflies Heliconius mimetic in colour pattern were also mimetic in motion. Here, I investigate whether wing motion changes with the flight demands of different behaviours. If birds select for wing motion as a warning signal, aposematic butterflies should maintain wing motion independently of behavioural context. Members of one mimicry group ( Heliconius cydno and Heliconius sapho) beat their wings more slowly and their wing strokes were more asymmetric than their sister-species ( Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, respectively), which were members of another mimicry group having a quick and steady wing motion. Within mimicry groups, wing beat frequency declined as its role in generating lift also declined in different behavioural contexts. In contrast, asymmetry of the stroke was not associated with wing beat frequency or behavioural context - strong indication that birds process and store the Fourier motion energy of butterfly wings. Although direct evidence that birds respond to subtle differences in butterfly wing motion is lacking, birds appear to generalize a motion pattern as much as they encounter members of a mimicry group in different behavioural contexts.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Flight is a key innovation in the evolution of insects that is crucial to their dispersal, migration, territoriality, courtship and predator avoidance. Male butterflies have characteristic territoriality and courtship flight behaviours, and females use a characteristic flight behaviour when searching for host plants. This implies that selection acts on wing morphology to maximize flight performance for conducting important behaviours among sexes. 2. Butterflies in the genus Morpho are obvious components of neotropical forests, and many observations indicate that they show two broad categories of flight behaviour and flight height. Although species can be categorized as using gliding or flapping flight, and flying at either canopy or understorey height, the association of flight behaviour and flight height with wing shape evolution has never been explored. 3. Two clades within Morpho differ in flight behaviour and height. Males and females of one clade inhabit the forest understorey and use flapping flight, whereas in the other clade, males use gliding flight at canopy level and females use flapping flight in both canopy and understorey. 4. We used independent contrasts to answer whether wing shape is associated with flight behaviour and height. Given a single switch to canopy habitation and gliding flight, we compared contrasts for the node at which the switch to canopy flight occurred with the distribution of values in the two focal clades. We found significant changes in wing shape at the transition to canopy flight only in males, and no change in size for either sex. A second node within the canopy clade suggests that other factors may also be involved in wing shape evolution. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that natural selection acts differently on male and female butterfly wing shape and indicate that the transition to canopy flight cannot explain all wing shape diversity in Morpho. 5. This study provides a starting point for characterizing evolution of wing morphology in forest butterflies in the contexts of habitat selection and flight behaviour. Further, these observations suggest that exploring wing shape evolution for canopy and understorey species in other insects may help understand the effects of habitat destruction on biological diversity.},

	abstract = {Due to a middle- to long-wavelength-sensitive (M/{LWS}) cone opsin polymorphism, there is considerable phenotypic variation in the color vision of New World monkeys. Many females have trichromatic vision, whereas some females and all males have dichromatic vision. The selective pressures that maintain this polymorphism are unclear. In the present study we compared the performance of dichromats and trichromats in a discrimination task. We examined tri- and dichromatic individuals of two species: brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). We also examined one protanomalous chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The subjects' task was to discriminate a circular pattern from other patterns in which textural elements differed in orientation and thickness from the background. After they were trained with stimuli of a single color, the subjects were presented with color-camouflaged stimuli with a green/red mosaic overlaid onto the pattern. The dichromatic monkeys and the protanomalous chimpanzee selected the correct stimulus under camouflaged conditions at rates significantly above chance levels, while the trichromats did not. These findings demonstrate that dichromatic nonhuman primates possess a superior visual ability to discriminate color-camouflaged stimuli, and that such an ability may confer selective advantages with respect to the detection of cryptic foods and/or predators.

	abstract = {Males typically have greater variance in reproductive success than females, so mothers should benefit by producing sons under favourable conditions. Being paired with a better-than-average mate is one such favourable circumstance. High-quality fathers can improve conditions for their offspring by providing good genes, good resources, or both, so females paired to such males should invest preferentially in sons. Ornamentation has been linked to male quality in many birds, and, in support of differential allocation theory, females of several avian species invest more in entire broods when paired to attractive mates. Additionally, the females of some bird species apparently manipulate the primary sex ratio of their broods in relation to the attractiveness of their mates. However, empirical support for a link between mate ornamentation and preferential feeding of sons (another form of biased investment) is lacking. We tested for correlations between sex-biased parental investment and mate plumage colour in the eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis, a species in which juveniles have sexually dichromatic {UV} blue plumage. We found that the proportion of maternal feeding attempts to fledgling sons (versus fledgling daughters) was positively correlated with structurally coloured plumage ornamentation of fathers. Additionally, paternal feeding attempts to sons were correlated with plumage ornamentation of mothers and increased in fathers that had breast plumage characteristics typical of older males. These results provide further support for the idea that parental strategies are influenced by mate attractiveness and provide the first evidence that mate ornamentation can influence parental behaviour even after offspring have left the nest.

In many species, males of higher phenotypic quality ( e. g., plumage color) are more likely to obtain {EPFs}; however, predictors of {WPF} success have been less consistently identified. Moreover, few studies have examined the influence of ecological variables on patterns of paternity, even though environmental conditions are known to affect mating behavior of male and female birds. In this study, we examined phenotypic and ecological factors influencing patterns of paternity in broods of mountain bluebirds, Sialia currucoides. We show that brighter, bluer males were more likely to obtain {EPFs} in first broods but that plumage color did not predict the ability of males to maintain paternity in their own nest. We then examined the effect of food availability in first broods on the probability of males losing paternity in second broods within the same season. Females that were provided with supplemental food throughout first breeding attempts were less likely to produce extrapair offspring in second broods, and we suggest that supplemented females may have been less likely to seek extrapair mating opportunities because they perceived their social mates to be of higher quality under conditions of enhanced food availability. Our results demonstrate that ecological variables such as food availability can influence patterns of paternity and suggest that consideration of environmental context will be important for future research investigating mate choice and sexual selection in socially monogamous species.},

Crab spiders (Thomisidae) hunt mostly on flowers and need to find appropriate hunting sites. Previous studies have shown that some crab spiders that reflect {UV} light use {UV} contrast to enhance prey capture. The high {UV} contrast can be obtained either by modulation of body colouration or active selection of appropriate backgrounds for foraging. We show that crab spiders (Thomisus sp.) hunting on Spathiphyllum plants use chromatic contrast, especially {UV} contrast, to make themselves attractive to hymenopteran prey. Apart from that, they are able to achieve high {UV} contrast by active selection of non-{UV} reflecting surfaces when given a choice of {UV}-reflecting and non-{UV} reflecting surfaces in the absence of odour cues. Honeybees (Apis cerana) approached Spathiphyllum plants bearing crab spiders on which the spiders were high {UV}-contrast targets with greater frequency than those plants on which the {UV}-contrast of the spiders was low. Thus, crab spiders can perceive {UV} and may use it to choose appropriate backgrounds to enhance prey capture, by exploiting the attraction of prey such as honeybees to {UV}.},

	abstract = {Examination of historical persistence of integration patterns provides an important insight into understanding the origin and evolution of complex traits. Specifically, the distinct effects of developmental and functional integration on the evolution of complex traits are often overlooked. Because patterns of functional integration are commonly shaped by selection exerted by the external environment, whereas patterns of developmental integration can be determined by relatively environment-independent selection for developmental homeostasis, examination of historical persistence of morphological integration patterns among species should reveal the relative importance of current selection in the evolution of complex traits. We compared historical persistence of integration patterns produced by current developmental versus ecological requirements by examining the evolution of complex mandibular structures in nine species of soricid shrews. We found that, irrespective of phylogenetic relatedness of species, patterns of developmental and functional integration were highly concordant, suggesting that strong selection for developmental homeostasis favors concordant channeling of both internal and external variation. Overall, our results suggest that divergence in mandible shape among species closely follows variation in functional demands and ecological requirements regardless of phylogenetic relatedness among species.},

	abstract = {The stomatopod eye is divided into three distinct regions, two peripheral `hemispheres' and a dividing mid-band. Each of these areas has a separate function and it is the six rows of ommatidia in the mid-band which are the main subject of study here. Rows one to four of the mid-band are probably not sensitive to polarized light (paper I (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 334, 33-56 (1991))) and instead possess many structural features which suggest that they are concerned with colour analysis and perhaps colour vision. This, the second of two consecutive papers, examines these adaptations in detail. They include brightly coloured intrarhabdomal filters, apparent lateral filters and a photoreceptor tiering system unique to the crustacea. Cronin \& Marshall (J. comp. Physiol. 166, 261-275 (1989b)) have shown that mid-band rows one to four contains at least eight distinct visual pigments. These, in combination with the structures described here, allow the spectrum of light available to stomatopods to be sampled over a broad spectral range by receptors with narrowly tuned sensitivities. It is the photostable screening and filtering pigments, rather than the visual pigments, which are examined in detail in this paper. These have been divided into two categories: (i) the `standard' retinal pigments: those that are often found in other crustacean eyes; (ii) the `unusual' retinal pigments: some of these are unique to stomatopod eyes and may be involved in colour vision.},

The findings are discussed in view of recent Suggestions that {UV} reflection in penguins could be part of a communication system.

Similarly, some female traits can reflect genetic quality or condition and males could use this information in mate choice or in modulating parental investment. In our study, we examined the correlation of individual variation in egg colouration with female expression of a male ornament and how male feeding covaried with these two female traits in the spotless starling, in which egg colour varies widely between clutches and where both sexes possess showy throat feathers that are age dependent and that may signal individual quality. According to the {SSECH}, high-quality females (females with longer throat feathers) are expected to lay more colourful eggs than low-quality females and males should modify their feeding behaviour accordingly. By means of a principal component analysis, we found that most of the variation in egg colouration was due to brightness differences, and in a lower proportion to chromatic variation. Chromatic variation reflected a ultraviolet ({UV}) vs. greenness trade-off and was positively associated with throat feather length: females with larger throat feathers laid eggs with higher {UV} and lower green reflectance. However, egg brightness was not related to female feather length, as the {SSECH} would predict. Male feedings were positively related to female throat feather length and negatively related to chromatic variation, meaning that males contributed more to nests of females with long throat feathers who laid eggs with higher {UV} and lower green reflectance. In conclusion, our data provide mixed support for the {SSECH}: although egg chromatic variation was related to female expression of a male ornament and male parental care, we found no evidence that egg brightness was involved in these processes.},

The dominant model organism (Drosophila), research approaches, and traits of interest (sterility and inviability of hybrids) all harken back to this earlier era. Herein, we explore the factors that led to a rebirth of interest in the genetics of reproductive isolation and to the adoption of the approaches of an earlier generation of biologists. At the same time, we appeal for more intensive investigations of traits that reproductively isolate closely related species, inclusion of a greater range of organisms in studies of reproductive isolation, and focus on a broader range of questions surrounding speciation. We end with a description of ongoing quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) studies of conspecific sperm precedence in the ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and Allonemobius socius. We have found several {QTL} with large effects on variance in patterns of sperm utilization in backcross females. Moreover, some {QTL} have an antagonistic effect on conspecific sperm, a finding that lends support to the hypothesis that rapid evolution of conspecific sperm precedence is a by‐product of sexual conflict.},

To experimentally test the signal function of the red epaulets in male red-shouldered widowbirds, we manipulated epaulet colour and size (within natural variation), and observed the effects in two competitive contexts. First, in captivity, unfamiliar males with epaulets of different size or redness were staged in dyadic contests over food. Only epaulet manipulations significantly affected contest outcome; red epaulet males out-competed orange and control males, which in turn dominated blackened (no epaulet) males. Epaulet size manipulations had particularly strong effects; enlarged epaulet males vigorously defeated smaller epaulet males within colour treatments, whereas the independent effect of 'redness' (i.e., within size treatments) was much weaker. Second, in a field experiment, epaulets were manipulated prior to territory establishment. Males with enlarged epaulets acquired territories, whereas most males with blackened or reduced signals failed to obtain territories. Furthermore, among the territorial males, birds with enlarged epaulets defended larger territories and spent less time in boundary signalling, yet they received fewer intrusions from conspecifics. In contrast, epaulet manipulations had no effect on either female visitation rates or subsequent female settlement. These results concur with recent studies and suggest that the carotenoid-based epaulets of red-shouldered widowbirds are status signals, sexually selected through male contest competition for territories.},

	abstract = {Begging is a complex display involving a variety of different visual and auditory signals. Parents are thought to use these signals to adjust their investment in food provisioning. The mechanisms that ensure the honesty of begging displays as indicators of need have been recently investigated. It has been shown that levels of corticosterone (Cort), the hormone released during the stress response, increase during food shortage and are associated with an increased begging rate. In a recent study in house sparrows, although exogenous Cort increased begging rate, parents did not accordingly adjust their provisioning rate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Cort might affect the expression of other components of begging displays, such as flange color (a carotenoid-based trait). We experimentally increased levels of circulating Cort and investigated the effects of the treatment on (1) the flange coloration of the nestlings, (2) the behavioral response and (3) the parental allocation of food and (4) nestling condition and cell-mediated immune response. We found that Cort affected flange coloration in a condition-dependent way. Cort-injected nestlings had less yellow flanges than controls only when in poor body condition. Parental feeding rate was also affected by the Cort treatment in interaction with flange color. Feeding rate of Cort-injected nestlings was negatively and significantly correlated with flange color (nestlings with yellower flanges receiving more food), whereas feeding rate and flange color were not correlated in control chicks. We also found that nestlings injected with Cort showed a weaker immune response than controls. These results suggest that, indeed, Cort has the potential to affect multiple components of the begging display. As Cort levels naturally raise during fasting, parents have to take into account these multiple components to take a decision as to optimally share their investment among competing nestlings.

It remains unclear what role, if any, the basal melanin layer underlying this spongy layer plays in the production of coloration. Amelanism in birds with structural color is a `natural experiment' in which melanin pigmentation is lost, allowing us to identify the effects of the loss of melanin on structural color production. Here we use full-spectrum spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier analysis to compare the color and nanostructure of an amelanotic Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri Gmelin) feather with a normal blue Steller's jay feather. As a control, we also examined a white domestic chicken (Gallus gallus Linnaeus) feather. The pale amelanotic jay feather had a broad reflectance curve with a blue/green peak, while the typical blue feather had a typical distinct bell-shaped blue curve with a {UV}/violet peak. The white chicken feather had a typical white reflectance curve with no discrete peaks. Electron microscopy revealed that both the amelanotic and blue feather barbs contained well-formed spongy layers that were of the correct size and arrangement to produce their measured peak reflectance values, whereas the chicken feather had no spongy layer. The washed-out color of the amelanotic jay feather was thus most probably caused by the loss of the basal melanin layer, suggesting that melanin functions to absorb incoherently scattered white light from the feather barb thereby increasing the purity of the color produced by the spongy layer.},

We found that males were significantly larger than females. In addition, Steere's Liocichla have a prominent yellow plumage patch on the lores that was significantly larger in males than females for both live birds and museum specimens. We also used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the color of the yellow-green breast feathers of Steere's Liocichla and found no significant differences between males and females in brightness, intensity, saturation, or hue. However, females tended to have brighter breast plumage, particularly at long wavelengths. Collectively, these color variables were useful in discriminating birds according to sex when used in a discriminant function analysis. Our study suggests that sexual selection may be more widespread than once assumed, even among birds considered monomorphic, and emphasizes the need for additional data from tropical and subtropical species.},

In species where both sexes are ornamented, it is unclear whether the signal content of ornaments differs between males and females. We examined the immunological and physiological correlates of carotenoid-based bill and plumage ornamentation in American goldfinches Spinus tristis, a species in which bright orange bills are sexually monomorphic but yellow plumage is sexually dimorphic during the breeding season. Because bill color is dynamic over short periods while plumage color is static over longer time frames, we tested whether these signals have the potential to provide temporal information about immunity and condition. In both sexes, bill color (but not plumage color) was negatively related to leukocyte differential, a measure of recent stress, while plumage color (but not bill color) was positively related to resting metabolic rate. In females, bill color also positively correlated with immunoglobulin Y, a component of acquired immunity, while plumage color positively predicted natural antibody levels, a component of innate immunity. In males, neither bill color nor plumage color predicted immune function, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these signals vary with sex. Our results demonstrate that dynamic signals such as bill coloration do not merely reflect the same information provided by static signals but that these two classes of signal provide information about different temporal aspects of phenotypic quality. Furthermore, our results indicate that a signal expressed in both sexes has the potential to provide different information depending on the sex of the bearer.},

Ideally, the importance of coloration as a reproductive barrier would be tested by holding all traits constant and manipulating only colour to test its effect. In butterflies, researchers use paper models to manipulate female colour patterns and show strong male preference for conspecific female coloration. In African cichlids and poison frogs, researchers manipulate the light environment to test the importance of male colour in female preference for conspecifics. Here we use motorized models to test whether females in a pair of sexually dimorphic fish species (genus: Etheostoma) prefer conspecific over heterospecific male coloration. By isolating and manipulating specific components of male coloration, we show that females of both species significantly prefer conspecific male colour (red versus green) and pattern (stripe versus bars). These results provide strong evidence that female preference for conspecific male nuptial coloration may play a critical role in behavioural isolation.

	abstract = {Mating between relatives generally results in reduced offspring viability or quality, suggesting that selection should favor behaviors that minimize inbreeding. However, in natural populations where searching is costly or variation among potential mates is limited, inbreeding is often common and may have important consequences for both offspring fitness and phenotypic variation. In particular, offspring morphological variation often increases with greater parental relatedness, yet the source of this variation, and thus its evolutionary significance, are poorly understood. One proposed explanation is that inbreeding influences a developing organism's sensitivity to its environment and therefore the increased phenotypic variation observed in inbred progeny is due to greater inputs from environmental and maternal sources. Alternatively, changes in phenotypic variation with inbreeding may be due to additive genetic effects alone when heterozygotes are phenotypically intermediate to homozygotes, or effects of inbreeding depression on condition, which can itself affect sensitivity to environmental variation. Here we examine the effect of parental relatedness (as inferred from neutral genetic markers) on heritable and nonheritable components of developmental variation in a wild bird population in which mate choice is often constrained, thereby leading to inbreeding. We found greater morphological variation and distinct contributions of variance components in offspring from highly related parents: inbred offspring tended to have greater environmental and lesser additive genetic variance compared to outbred progeny. The magnitude of this difference was greatest in late-maturing traits, implicating the accumulation of environmental variation as the underlying mechanism. Further, parental relatedness influenced the effect of an important maternal trait (egg size) on offspring development. These results support the hypothesis that inbreeding leads to greater sensitivity of development to environmental variation and maternal effects, suggesting that the evolutionary response to selection will depend strongly on mate choice patterns and population structure.},

There was significant response to selection in all four selected lines and significant heritability for sensitivity. An examination of the spectral sensitivity function showed that the form of the response differed between the red and blue lines and among the red lines. Such divergence is likely because there are many different mechanisms allowing response to selection for spectral sensitivity. Diverse mechanisms allow a divergent response by different populations to the same selective pressures. Such a mechanism can promote diversity in vision and visual signals, and any multicomponent system where different components can respond to the same selective regime.},

Although many factors affecting host egg-recognition processes have already been evaluated, only a few attempts have been made to test the importance of light conditions in microhabitats of host nests. Here, we examined whether the objectively measured nest light environment affects great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) responses towards real common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) eggs. More specifically, we predicted that parasitic eggs will be rejected with a lower frequency from nests placed in darker conditions than those in lighter conditions. However, we found no effect of the ambient light on egg-rejection behaviour alone, but the photosynthetically active radiation exhibited a positive interactive effect with chromatic contrast between cuckoo and host eggs. Most rejection events were accomplished when cuckoo eggs of poor mimicry were laid in well-lit nests. Our study suggests that this phenomenon may have important implications for the evolution of egg mimicry and host egg discrimination. We encourage further testing of the light environment hypothesis in other host species breeding in variable nest microhabitats and light conditions.},

Interestingly, parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia have only been found within haplodiploid insects and it is not known whether this exclusivity is the result of functional constraints of Wolbachia. Here we find a unique pattern of Wolbachia infection that is associated with parthenogenesis in six species within the phytophagous mite genus Brvobia. Through antibiotic treatment we show that, in two species, {BrYobia} praetiosa and an unidentified species, the Wolbachia infection is strictly associated with parthenogenesis. Microsatellite loci show the mechanism of parthenogenesis to be functionally apomictic and not gamete duplication, with progeny identical to their infected mother. Crossing experiments within B. praetiosa showed no evidence of sexual reproduction. These results are discussed with reference to the distribution of parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia and the diversification of the Bryobia genus.},

Contrast with the background may accentuate the signal's costliness and make the male more conspicuous to predators. Both effects should contribute to increase male attractiveness. It is therefore conceivable that the extent to which the male plumage contrasts against the background modifies female choice behavior as it improves the discrimination of mates. We tested this hypothesis in domesticated canaries (Serinus canaria ). In the first experiment, yellow females could choose between two yellow males presented in front of a yellow and a white background, respectively. In the second experiment we replaced the yellow males with white ones. In experiment 1 females associated significantly more with yellow males which contrasted strongly against the white background. In experiment 2 there was at least a trend for preferred associations with the white male in front of the yellow background. We found no support that male properties per se were chosen. We could further clarify that females associated with the contrasting male and not with a particular background color. Thus, our study demonstrates that not only inherent properties of the sender but also the interaction of bird color with the signaling environment may influence mate choice.},

They manipulate the reproduction of hosts to facilitate their spread into host populations, through ways such as cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), parthenogenesis, feminization and male killing. The influence of Wolbachia infection on host populations has attracted considerable interest in their possible role in speciation and as a potential agent of biological control. In this study, we used both microinjection and nested {PCR} to show that the Wolbachia naturally infecting Drosophila simulans can be transferred into a naturally Wolbachia-infected strain of the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus, with up to 30\% superinfection frequency in the F-12 generation. The superinfected males of L. striatellus showed unidirectional {CI} when mated with the original single-infected females, while superinfected females of L. striatellus were compatible with superinfected or single-infected males. These results are, to our knowledge, the first to establish a superinfected horizontal transfer route for Wolbachia between phylogenetically distant insects. The segregation of Wolbachia from superinfected L. striatellus was observed during the spreading process, which suggests that Wolbachia could adapt to a phylogenetically distant host with increased infection frequency in the new host population; however, it would take a long time to establish a high-frequency superinfection line. This study implies a novel way to generate insect lines capable of driving desired genes into Wolbachia-infected populations to start population replacement.},

	abstract = {The colourful appearance of bird eggshells has long fascinated biologists and considerable research effort has focused on the structure and biochemistry of the avian eggshell matrix. The presence of tetrapyrrole pigments was identified nearly a century ago. Surprisingly, how the concentrations of avian eggshell pigments vary among related species, and whether this variability is associated with either eggshell appearance and/or species life-history traits, remains poorly understood. We quantified the concentrations of the two key eggshell pigments, protoporphyrin {IX} and biliverdin, from a diverse sample of eggshells stored at the Natural History Museum, Tring, {UK}. We explicitly tested how these two pigments are associated with physical measures of eggshell coloration and whether the pigment concentrations and colour diversity co-vary with phylogenetic affiliations among species. We also tested a series of comparative hypotheses regarding the association between the concentrations of the two pigments and specific life-history and breeding ecology traits. Across species, the average concentrations of protoporphyrin and biliverdin were positively correlated, and both strongly co-varied with phylogenetic relatedness. Controlling for phylogeny, protoporphyrin concentration was associated with a higher likelihood of cavity nesting and ground nesting, whereas biliverdin concentration was associated with a higher likelihood of non-cavity nesting habit and bi-parental provisioning. Although unlikely to be explained by a single function, the breeding ecology and life history-dependence of eggshell pigment concentrations in these comparative analyses implies that related species share pigment strategies, and that those strategies relate to broad adaptive roles in the evolution of variation in avian eggshell coloration and its underlying mechanisms.

We examined the potential for male-female and adult-subadult differences in plumage coloration in the genus Aphelocoma. This group of jays comprises 10 phylogenetic species, which are found across southern and central North America and include cooperatively breeding species, as well as species that form socially monogamous pair-bonds typical of most species of birds. Our goal was to determine whether male-female and adult-subadult differences in plumage coloration were more common in species with complex social systems (i.e., cooperative breeders). We collected a series of reflectance measurements from hundreds of museum specimens and analyzed the results using a model of an avian visual system. We found that age- and sex-related differences were not more frequent in species that practice cooperative breeding. Hence, plumage signaling relating sex and age may not be strongly associated with complex social systems. Rather, the relative lack of a stable and familiar social environment, as well as other selective pressures and constraints (e.g., habitat use and plumage complexity), may have favored a greater degree of age- and sex-related differences in plumage coloration in jays that practice simple biparental care.},

While numerous correlative studies suggest that parasite infection decreases the intensity of carotenoid-based colour displays, the existence of this trade-off has never been demonstrated experimentally in a host-parasite model. In this study, we used the blackbird (Turdus merula) and Isospora (an intestinal parasite) to assess whether this trade-off does indeed exist. Blackbirds were supplemented with carotenoids while simultaneously being exposed to parasites. Supplemented males circulated more carotenoids in the blood and developed more brightly coloured bills than unsupplemented males. In addition, supplementation slowed down the replication rate of parasites. Supplementation with carotenoids enabled infected birds to maintain their bill coloration, whereas birds that were infected but not supplemented showed reduced bill coloration. At the same time, infection slowed carotenoid assimilation in the blood. Overall, we demonstrated that bill colour reflects a bird's health, and that only males with a carotenoid-rich diet are capable of coping with costs associated with parasitic infection. Carotenoids are thus traded off between host physiological response to parasites and secondary sexual traits. Further investigations are required to determine the physiological mechanisms that govern this trade-off.},

We assessed the relation between achromatic plumage reflectance, dominance rank, body condition, and reproductive success in male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. We measured plumage reflectance for five body regions of 40 male chickadees in late winter and monitored these males throughout the following breeding season to determine whether they survived to breed, whether they successfully paired, whether their partner laid eggs, and both their apparent and realized reproductive success. As expected from past studies, a male's dominance rank significantly predicted whether his partner laid eggs. However, only achromatic plumage reflectance significantly predicted other measures of male reproductive performance. Among males who fledged at least one offspring, both the brightness of white plumage regions and the {UV}-chroma of melanin-based plumage regions were significant predictors of the proportion of within-pair young in their nests. When we consider all males we measured, assigning zero values to males who failed to sire any offspring, the {UV}-chroma of melanin-based plumage regions was a significant predictor of realized reproductive success. Bib size was also related to male realized reproductive success. Our findings suggest that individual variation in achromatic plumage may play an important role in sexual signaling in chickadees.},

	abstract = {A male bowerbird visual signal includes his own plumage, a structure he constructs out of plant material and coloured objects (ornaments) he places on or near the structure to make up the bower. Plumage and bower together are used to attract females for mating. Ornaments are known to contrast with plumage, bower structure and visual backgrounds in seven Australian bowerbird species (Endler et al. 2005, Evolution, 50, 1795-1818). We estimated the colour preferences in a wild population of great bowerbirds using artificially coloured objects widely spaced in bird colour space. We found that these birds prefer colours that contrast with their own plumage, the bower structure and the visual backgrounds adjacent to the bower, and that they have very strong dislikes for colours that are similar to their own plumage and to the visual backgrounds. The range of disliked colour hues was much narrower than the range of preferred hues, suggesting that the word 'preference' may be misleading. Preferences for colour are inherently multidimensional and should be studied in the context of their function. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Facultative bacterial endosymbionts can transfer horizontally among lineages of their arthropod hosts, providing the recipient with a suite of traits that can lead to rapid evolutionary response, as has been recently demonstrated. But how common is symbiont-driven evolution? Evidence suggests that successful symbiont transfers are most likely within a species or among closely related species, although more distant transfers have occurred over evolutionary history. Symbiont-driven evolution need not be a function of a recent horizontal transfer, however. Many endosymbionts infect only a small proportion of a host population, but could quickly increase in frequency under favorable selection regimes. Some host species appear to accumulate a diversity of facultative endosymbionts, and it is among these species that symbiont-driven evolution should be most prevalent. It remains to be determined how frequently symbionts enable rapid evolutionary response by their hosts, but substantial ecological effects are a likely consequence whenever it does occur.},

	abstract = {1. Fruits are among the most antioxidant-rich foods in nature and thus can be important dietary sources for combating oxidative stress in animals and humans. 2. Because fruits are pigmented by important plant antioxidants such as anthocyanins and carotenoids, frugivores may be able to gauge the antioxidant value of a fruit by its colour. However, although the importance of dietary antioxidants and oxidative stress is increasingly being acknowledged in evolutionary ecology, it is unknown whether animals can use visual signals to detect the presence of antioxidants in their food. 3. We studied the colour and pigment content of 60 bird-dispersed fruits and used an avian eye model to assess the ability of birds to visually discriminate carotenoid and anthocyanin contents of fruits. We then tested whether the frugivorous European blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) preferentially consumes food containing anthocyanins. 4. Fruit colour variation was explained by variation in anthocyanin contents, and birds were capable of discriminating anthocyanin concentrations in fruits based on colour because fruits rich in anthocyanins are black or {UV} reflecting. However, we found that birds could not use colouration to determine the carotenoid contents of fruits. Ripe fruits contained more anthocyanins than unripe fruits, while there was no difference between ripe and unripe fruits in carotenoid contents. Anthocyanin contents correlated with caloric value in fruits, while there was no such correlation between carotenoids and total energy contents. 5. In food choice experiments, blackcaps selected food containing anthocyanins over food without anthocyanins. 6. In sum, our results indicate that birds actively selected for anthocyanins in their food and that they may use fruit colour as a foraging signal of anthocyanin antioxidant rewards.},

The chickens played the role of receivers that can respond to the preferred stimuli displayed by the sender on a peck-sensitive computer screen. The preferred stimulus was kept and evolved, in the direction specified by the chicken, before being introduced to the next chicken of the successive generation. The chickens were tested on signals changing in three dimensions: length, intensity and area. In all three cases, the signals became considerably exaggerated and beyond what was required for accurate discrimination. Our results support the hypothesis that response biases emerging in discrimination tasks are sufficient to cause the evolution of signal exaggeration.

Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned turkeys to three experimental groups: we maintained six turkeys free of coccidial infection, inoculated four turkeys with a single species of coccidial oocvsts, and inoculated six turkeys with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of wing covert and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male turkeys such that infected males showed proportionately less {UV} reflectance in their wing covert and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild turkeys, iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health.},

A second experiment involved addition of orange coloration to the wings of 93 males before mating trials. Our results indicate that one component of the orange color (saturation) correlated with mating success in our first experiment. Furthermore, wing color manipulations had no effect, but the original saturation values of the males in the second experiment were directly related to mating success. Our results provide the first evidence that wing color in monarch butterflies relates to mating success, and they serve as an important starting point for future research.},

Cuckoos place hosts under selection to detect and reject foreign eggs, while host defences result in the evolution of host-egg mimicry in cuckoos. Despite a long history of research, egg pattern mimicry has never been objectively quantified, and so its coevolution with host defences has not been properly assessed. Here, we use digital image analysis and modelling of avian vision to quantify the level of pattern mimicry in eight host species of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus and their respective cuckoo host-races. We measure a range of pattern attributes, including marking size, diversity in size, contrast, coverage and dispersion. This new technique reveals hitherto unnoticed sophistication in egg pattern mimicry. We show that various features of host egg pattern are mimicked by the eggs of their respective cuckoo host-races, and that cuckoos have evolved better pattern mimicry for host species that exhibit stronger egg rejection. Pattern differs relatively more between eggs of different host species than between their respective cuckoo host-races. We suggest that cuckoos may have more 'average' markings in order to be able to use subsidiary hosts. Our study sheds new light on cuckoo-host coevolution and illustrates a new technique for quantifying animal markings with respect to the relevant animal visual system.},

To this end, we analysed snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus), including the mixta and nivea mutants, in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical tests with bumblebees. The {MIXTA} locus controls petal epidermal cell shape, and thus the path that incident light takes within the pigment-containing cells. The effect is that mixta mutant flowers are pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers, and mutants lack the sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human observers. Despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans, and even though bees could discriminate the flowers, inexperienced bees exhibited no preference for either type, and the flowers did not differ in their detectability in a Y-maze-either when the flowers appeared in front of a homogeneous or a dappled background. Equally counterintuitive effects were found for the non-pigmented, {UV} reflecting nivea mutant: even though the overall reflectance intensity and {UV} signal of nivea flowers is several times that of wild type flowers, their detectability was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers. In addition, naive foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants, even though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types. Our results show that single mutations affecting flower signal can have profound effects on pollinator behaviour-but not in ways predictable by crude assessments via human perception, nor simple quantification of {UV} signals. However, current models of bee visual perception predict the observed effects very well.},

	abstract = {Colourful plumages observed in many birds provide ideal systems for investigating the control and function of animal signals, because we can identify the molecular currency (e.g. pigments, tissue structures) and thus the challenges associated with the production of the trait. To date, most attention has been paid to the signalling costs and benefits of the common pigmentary (e.g. carotenoid- and melanin-based) plumage colours. However, in penguins, the colour of feathers of crests or patches of head plumage is based on an unusual fluorescent pigment, presently thought to be in the class of pterin pigments, which are typically found as colourants in other animals like butterflies and amphibians. These yellow-orange colours may be used in sexual or social communication, but to date little is known about the signalling potential of such ornaments. We collected yellow crest-feathers from adult male and female Snares Penguins (Eudyptes robustus) in two years (2002 and 2003) and examined differences in colour and pigment content as a function of year, sex, body size and body condition. Unlike the typical pattern of birds, crests of female Snares Penguins contained higher concentrations of pigments than those of males. In both years, yellower feathers in females contained more yellow pigment. Birds of both sexes grew yellower and more pigment-rich feathers in 2002 - a year in which birds were in better condition - than in 2003. Males with yellower crests also tended to be larger, heavier and in better condition, regardless of year. These results highlight the potential for yellow crests in Snares Penguins to serve as a condition-dependent indicator to conspecifics. Further work is needed to determine whether or not this plumage trait is a signal of social status or attractiveness, as colourful plumage patches appear to be in other penguin species.},

	abstract = {Variation in genetic-based coloration is widespread among vertebrates, yet the underlying mechanisms explaining this polymorphism maintenance remain poorly known. Gene-by-environment interactions on fitness traits in a fluctuating environment are often invoked to explain the maintenance of such color diversity. According to this hypothesis, variation in coloration could signal alternative life-history strategies to cope with variable environmental conditions. However, empirical studies testing this hypothesis are still rare. Here, we aimed at comparing the variation of body mass maintenance behavior and reproductive traits between differently colored individuals in alternative environments. We exposed differently colored captive feral pigeons to different food conditions and immune challenges and measured their investment in body mass maintenance, egg laying, and offspring quality. Under food restriction, darker eumelanic females had a higher egg production, but darker adults tended to lose more body mass than paler conspecifics. Moreover, offspring reared in food-limited conditions had a higher body mass at fledging when sired by darker biological fathers, suggesting a positive genetic effect of a darker eumelanic coloration in harsh food conditions. In contrast, when food was abundant, pale- and dark-colored females had a similar egg production, but darker adults lost significantly less body mass than paler conspecifics. The immune challenge had no effect on adult body mass maintenance and reproduction. Differently colored individuals may thus display alternative reaction norms to different food conditions, suggesting that eumelanin-based coloration reflects how animals cope with variations in food availability. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of food availability in natural systems may thus play a central role in the evolution of melanin-based coloration in wild animal populations.},

Two subspecies, Gypaetus barbatus barbatus (Eurasia and North Africa populations) and Gypaetus barbatus meridionalis (Eastern and Southern Africa), have been described on the basis of plumage colour differences. The plumage of G. b. barbatus tends to be darker in comparison with that of G. b. meridionalis. The plumage of the two subspecies differ in the feathering of the tarsi (more abundant in G. b. barbatus) and presence/absence of dark car tufts (only present in G. b. barbatus, and this being the most useful character to distinguish adult specimens of both subspecies). When exposing skins under the sun or to electric bulbs in a cold room, temperature increases were significantly higher in the black ear tufts than in the frontal region of the head, suggesting that the melanized ear patch of G. b. barbatus serves, at least, to heat up the air entering the car channel and perhaps also the underlying skin. In addition, G. b. barbatus, which inhabits mountainous regions with harsh and long winters, would benefit more from feathered tarsi to prevent heat loss through the legs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Sexual selection is widely viewed as playing a central role in haplochromine cichlid speciation. Hypothetically, once divergent mate preferences evolve among populations of these fishes, reproductive isolation follows and the populations begin to behave as different species. Various studies have examined patterns of assortative mating among species and sometimes populations, but few have examined variation in directional preferences, especially among populations of the same species. We investigated mate choice behavior in two populations of Labeotropheus fuelleborni, a Lake Malawi endemic. We test whether mating preferences between populations are based on the same traits and in the same direction as preferences within populations. We examine the potential contributions of two classes of trait, color patterns and behaviors, to reproductive isolation. When females chose between either two males of their own population, or two from another, female preferences were generally similar (for the female population) across the two contexts. Mate choice patterns differed between (female) populations for a measure of color, but only modestly for male behavior. In a separate experiment we simultaneously offered females a male of their own population and a male from a different population. In these trials, females consistently preferred males from their own population, which were also the males that displayed more frequently than their opponents, but not necessarily those with color traits suggested to be most attractive in the previous experiment. Thus directional preferences for chroma and related aspects of color may be important when females are presented with males of otherwise similar phenotypes, but may play little role in mediating assortative mating among populations with substantially different color patterns. A preference for male behavior could play some role in speciation if males preferentially court same-population females, as we have observed for the populations studied herein [Current Zoology 58 (3): 475-483, 2012].},

Whether such maternal effects occur in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) has an important bearing on mate preference evolution. 2. By raising female guppies from birth on different dietary carotenoid levels, we examined the pattern of carotenoid allocation to maternal tissue (skin) vs. eggs. Skin carotenoid content was only weakly affected by carotenoid intake while egg carotenoid content was strongly affected. 3. We then tested for effects of maternal carotenoid intake on several measures of offspring quality, including size and condition at birth, juvenile growth rate, and the size, condition, skin carotenoid content and colouration of mature sons. To test for interactions between maternal and offspring carotenoid intake, broods were split and offspring were reared on one of two carotenoid levels. 4. Offspring carotenoid intake had the expected effects on male colouration, but otherwise we found no evidence that maternal or offspring carotenoid intake influences offspring quality. It remains possible that maternal carotenoids affect offspring fitness parameters that we did not measure or that such effects depend on environmental factors that were absent in our laboratory aquaria. 5. Our review of the literature on maternal carotenoid effects in birds and fishes suggests that such effects may be taxon-specific. Thus, it seems unwarranted to assume that an adaptive trade-off necessarily exists between allocation of carotenoids to eggs vs. maternal tissues. Alternative hypotheses, such as the possibility that eggs provide a means of excreting excess carotenoids, also merit consideration. 6. Our results indirectly support the indicator model of mate preference evolution by casting doubt on an alternative hypothesis that requires females to benefit more from consuming carotenoids than males do.},

Estimates of megafauna biomass (including humans as a megafauna species) for before, during, and after the extinction episode suggest that growth of human biomass largely matched the loss of non-human megafauna biomass until approximate to 12,000 years ago. Then, total megafauna biomass crashed, because many non-human megafauna species suddenly disappeared, whereas human biomass continued to rise. After the crash, the global ecosystem gradually recovered into a new state where megafauna biomass was concentrated around one species, humans, instead of being distributed across many species. Precrash biomass levels were finally reached just before the Industrial Revolution began, then skyrocketed above the precrash baseline as humans augmented the energy available to the global ecosystem by mining fossil fuels. Implications include (j) an increase in human biomass (with attendant hunting and other impacts) intersected with climate change to cause the Quaternary Megafauna Extinction and an ecological threshold event, after which humans became dominant in the global ecosystem; (h) with continued growth of human biomass and today's unprecedented global warming, only extraordinary and stepped-up conservation efforts will prevent a new round of extinctions in most body-size and taxonomic spectra; and (iii) a near-future biomass crash that will unfavorably impact humans and their domesticates and other species is unavoidable unless alternative energy sources are developed to replace dwindling supplies of fossil fuels.},

We found that female {UV} wing color changes seasonally, the color being more pronounced in summer than in spring or autumn. We also demonstrated that male mate preference changes seasonally, concomitantly with the change in female {UV} color. Specifically, males appearing in summer exhibit a mating preference for summer-form females over spring- or autumn-form females, while those appearing in spring or autumn exhibit no seasonal preference, thereby facilitating more effective mate location. Our results suggest that this field of study will require more strictly controlled experimental investigation in which the seasonal change in {UV} color is considered when {UV}-influenced mating behaviors such as mate choice are investigated.},

In polymorphic species, individuals of the same sex and age display different heritable melanin-based color morphs, associated with physiological and reproductive parameters and possibly alternative strategies to cope with variation in environmental conditions. We examined whether the role of corticosterone in resolving the trade-off between self-maintenance and reproductive activities covaries with the size of melanin-based spots displayed on the ventral body side of male barn owls. Administration of corticosterone to simulate physiological stress in males revealed pronounced changes in their food-provisioning rates to nestlings compared to control males. Corticosterone-treated males with small eumelanic spots reduced nestling provisioning rates as compared to controls, and also to a greater degree than did corticosterone-treated males with large spots. Large-spotted males generally exhibited lower parental provisioning and appear insensitive to exogenous corticosterone suggesting that the size of the black spots on the breast feathers predicts the ability to cope with stressful situations. The reduced provisioning rate of corticosterone-treated males caused a temporary reduction in nestling growth rates but, did not affect fledgling success. This suggests that moderately elevated corticosterone levels are not inhibitory to current reproduction but rather trigger behavioral responses to maximize lifetime reproductive success.

While preening is known to be an important component of plumage maintenance, it has received little attention with respect to colouration. We investigated whether preening can influence plumage reflectance and whether females show a preference for plumage cleanliness in captive-bred, wild-type budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus. To do this, we compared the spectral colour of birds that were allowed to preen their plumage and individuals that were prevented from preening. The plumage of birds that were prevented from preening showed a significant lower reflectance in the {UV} range (300-400 nm). Subsequently, we measured females' preferences for preened and unpreened males using a two-choice test. In a second experiment we allowed females to choose between an unpreened male and a male smeared with {UV}-absorbing chemicals ({UV}-blocked male). The proportion of time that females stayed near preened males was statistically higher than for unpreened males, but females spent similar amounts of time with unpreened males and {UV}-blocked males. These results are consistent with the idea that female budgerigars are able to discriminate between preened and unpreened males, and that {UV} colours, mediated by preening, can convey information about a bird's current condition.

Female ornaments may be correlated effects of selection on males or have signaling functions in their own right. In the facultatively polygynous starling Sturnus vulgaris, both sexes possess iridescent throat feathers, which are actively displayed during Courtship by males. This paper investigates the reproductive correlates of throat feather ornaments in both sexes. Bird-perceived hue and components of feather length covaried strongly, and a summary variable (the first principal component [{PCI}]) was extracted using Principal component analysis. Sex and age-related differences were found for {PCI}. Positive assortative mating was found with respect to age and {PCI}. However, the relative influences of ornamentation and age on breeding variables were hard to separate, so effects may be related to other age-related variables. This provides a cautionary note for studies of ornamentation where age is unknown. However, we argue that throat feathers in starlings may signal age and age-related quality measures in both sexes. Older females with higher {PCI} scores bred earlier and laid larger clutches with higher hatching, success, older males with higher {PCI} scores had higher chances of becoming polygynous and attracting high reproductive quality females. {PCI} showed no relationship with parental care in either sex. Direct reproductive benefits for males and indirect genetic benefits for either sex may drive mate choice based on these age-related characters. However, only experimental manipulation can determine whether ornamentation signals quality variation within age classes.},

	abstract = {Several reproductive barriers exist within the Nasonia species complex, including allopatry, premating behavioral isolation, postzygotic inviability and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. Here we show that hybrid males suffer two additional reproductive disadvantages, an inability to properly court females and decreased sperm production. Hybrid behavioral sterility, characterized by a reduced ability of hybrids to perform necessary courtship behaviors, occurs in hybrids between two species of Nasonia. Hybrid males produced in crosses between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti courted females at a reduced frequency (23-69\%), compared with wild-type N. vitripennis and N. giraulti males ({\textgreater} 93\%). Reduced courtship frequency was not a simple function of inactivity among hybrids. A strong effect of cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) background was also found in N. vitripennis and N. giraulti crosses; F2 hybrids with giraulti cytoplasm showing reduced ability at most stages of courtship. Hybrids produced between a younger species pair, N. giraulti and N. longicornis, were behaviorally fertile. All males possessed motile sperm, but sperm production is greatly reduced in hybrids between the older species pair, N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. This effect on hybrid males, lowered sperm counts rather than nonfunctional sperm, is different from most described cases of hybrid male sterility, and may represent an earlier stage of hybrid sperm breakdown. The results add to previous studies of F2 hybrid inviability and behavioral sterility, and indicate that Wolbachia-induced hybrid incompatibility has arisen early in species divergence, relative to behavioral sterility and spermatogenic infertility.

We quantified stickleback color and environmental lighting using methods independent of human perception to evaluate the information transmitted by male signals in a habitat where these signals are displayed. We also developed models of chromatic processing based on four cone photopigments (peak absorptions at 360, 445, 530, and 605 nm) characterized microspectrophotometrically in G. aculeatus and three other stickleback species. We show that a simple opponent mechanism receiving equally weighted inputs from cones with peak absorptions at 445 nm and 605 nm efficiently encodes variation in male throat colors. An orthogonal opponent mechanism-the difference between outputs of 530-nm cones and mean of outputs of 445- and 605-nm cones-produces a neural signal that could be used for species recognition and would be largely insensitive to variation in male throat color. We also show that threespine stickleback throats/photopigments are optimized for this coding scheme. These and other findings lead to testable hypotheses about the spectral processing mechanisms present in the threespine stickleback visual systems and the evolutionary interactions that have shaped this signal/receiver system.},

	abstract = {Color-vision polymorphism in New World monkeys occurs because of an allelic polymorphism of the single-copy red-green middle-to-long-wavelength-sensitive (M/{LWS}) opsin gene on the X chromosome. Because color-vision types can readily be estimated from allelic types of the M/{LWS} opsin gene, this polymorphic system offers researchers an excellent opportunity to study the association between vision and behavior. As a prerequisite for such studies, genetically determined color-vision types must be concordant with phenotypes determined directly by behavioral criteria (e.g., by a color discrimination test). However, such correlations between genotypes and phenotypes have been studied only for callitrichine species. Using genetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, we evaluated the color vision of brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a representative non-callitrichine model animal for physiology and behavior. Two allelic M/{LWS} opsins-P545 and P530-were identified in the studied captive population. Females had one or both of the alleles, and males had either one. The retinal sensitivity in P530 dichromats was short-wave shifted relative to that in P545 dichromats, whereas that in P530/P545 trichromats was between the two groups. In a discrimination task using Ishihara pseudo-isochromatic plates, P530/P545 trichromats were successful in discriminating stimuli that P530 and P545 dichromats were unable to discriminate. In a foodsearch task, P530/1`545 trichromats were able to locate red targets among green distracters as quickly as among white distracters, whereas both types of dichromats took longer. These results demonstrate the mutual consistency between genotypes and phenotypes of color vision, and provide a solid genetic basis on which the ecology and evolution of color vision can be investigated.

	abstract = {Evidence that similar color patterns occur in unrelated animals with different habits undermines the traditional view that homoplasy evolves through shared ecological selection pressures. Carotenoid pigments responsible for many yellow to red signals exhibit two related properties that could link ecology with appearance by nontraditional means. Ecologic homoplasy could arise through ecophenotypy because all animals must obtain carotenoids through their diet. Such homoplasy also could be hidden from view because increased carotenoid levels are more strongly encoded by decreased reflectance over ultraviolet ({UV}) wavelengths invisible to humans. To explore these possibilities, I examined apparent matches or mismatches between color and ecology among insectivorous (low carotenoid diet) and frugivorous (high carotenoid diet) bird species in relation to the typical yellow and black plumage pattern of insectivorous, {UV}-sensitive titmice (Paridae). Diagnostic features of reflectance spectra indicated that all yellow plumages resulted from carotenoids, black plumages from melanins, and olive green plumages from codeposition of both pigments. However, reflectance by carotenoid-bearing plumages correlated with diet independent of plumage pattern; compared to the insectivores, frugivores had reduced amounts of {UV} reflectance, and to a lesser extent, "red shifts" in longer-wavelength reflectance. Furthermore, an asymptotic decrease in amount of {UV} with increased redness implied that plumage reflectance of insectivorous species differed more over {UV} wavelengths, whereas that of frugivorous species differed more over longer wavelengths. I verified that dietary links to plumage reflectance resulted from greater amounts of plumage carotenoids in frugivores, presumably due to their carotenoid-rich diets. All of these ecological associations transcended post-mortem or post-breeding color change, and phylogeny. Thus, predictable associations between avian-visible plumage reflectance, pigmentation, and diet across evolutionary scales may arise directly (diet per se) or indirectly (honest signaling of diet) by ecophenotypy, although various genetic factors also may play a role.},

This is made possible by their complex skin, which contains pigmented chromatophore organs and structural light reflectors (iridophores and leucophores). Iridophores create colorful and linearly polarized reflective patterns. Equally interesting, the photoreceptors of cephalopod eyes are arranged in a way to give these animals the ability to detect the linear polarization of incoming light. The capacity to detect polarized light may have a variety of functions, such as prey detection, navigation, orientation and contrast enhancement. Because the skin of cephalopods can produce polarized reflective patterns, it has been postulated that cephalopods could communicate intraspecifically through this visual system. The term `hidden' or `private' communication channel has been given to this concept because many cephalopod predators may not be able to see their polarized reflective patterns. We review the evidence for polarization vision as well as polarization signaling in some cephalopod species and provide examples that tend to support the notion – currently unproven – that some cephalopods communicate using polarized light signals.},

The two principal explanations for the evolution of this adaptive strategy are (1) natural selection for crypsis (camouflage) against a range of different backgrounds and (2) selection for conspicuous social signals that maximise detectability to conspecifics, yet minimise exposure to predators because they are only briefly displayed. Here we show that evolutionary shifts in capacity for colour change in southern African dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion spp.) are associated with increasingly conspicuous signals used in male contests and courtship. To the chameleon visual system, species showing the most dramatic colour change display social signals that contrast most against the environmental background and amongst adjacent body regions. We found no evidence for the crypsis hypothesis, a finding reinforced by visual models of how both chameleons and their avian predators perceive chameleon colour variation. Instead, our results suggest that selection for conspicuous social signals drives the evolution of colour change in this system, supporting the view that transitory display traits should be under strong selection for signal detectability.},

It has become common practice that suggested lists of indicator species pass through a process of coordination involving several experts and stakeholders. Therefore, an 'aptitude test' for indicator species was needed that would be transparent as well as comprehensible. The starting list of potentially suitable indicator species was filtered using criteria that removed rare, toxic and ubiquitous species and retained representative species relevant for extensively managed grassland habitats of Brandenburg and species that are easy to detect and identify. Vegetation surveys conducted on 50-m transects in about 120 grassland fields in Brandenburg served as the database for the validation. The data were grouped by the mean moisture levels of the sites. We examined the influence of the presence or absence of potentially suitable indicator species on diversity quality criteria for each site group using a single species testing procedure. Besides floristic species diversity (overall species number), the number of species indicating extensive use and the number of Red List species are criteria that can be used. In addition, weighted indices were computed which pool together the three quality criteria to establish a ranking of the pre-selected species. The quality criteria can be differentially combined depending on the needs of the individual project.},

An alternative mechanism posits that a preference results from a preestablished bias in the female information-processing system arising from sources independent of sexual selection. Male traits then arise that are selected by this preexisting preference. The genus Xiphophorus consists of swordless platyfish and swordtails. Swordlessness is the primitive state. In this study, female platyfish, X. maculatus, were found to prefer conspecific males with artificial swords over those without swords, despite evidence that the common ancestor of platyfish and swordtails was swordless. These results suggest that the evolution of the sword in the swordtail clade was a consequence of selection arising from a preexisting bias.},

	abstract = {The common cuckoo Cuculus canorus parasitism greatly reduces the reproductive success of its hosts and imposes strong selection pressure for hosts to evolve defences against parasitism, such as the ability to recognize and reject dissimilar parasitic eggs, which, in turn, selects for better egg mimicry by the cuckoo. In the co-evolutionary interaction, however, it remains unknown how the cuckoo successfully expanded its range of host usage and how they developed egg mimicry. Most previous studies were conducted in areas where a very few number of host species (i.e. one or two at most) are sympatric with the cuckoo. Several host species, however, breed sympatric with the cuckoo and have been parasitized in the study site in Nagano, central Japan. Such a multiple-hosts system will provide valuable insights for understanding the cuckoo-hosts interactions in the past. In the present study, we report quantitative profiles of eggs based on spectrometer reflectance for four major host species and the corresponding cuckoo gentes. The hosts include the oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis), bull-headed shrike (Lanius bucephalus), azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana), and black-faced bunting (Emberiza spodocephala). We show that (1) egg morphs of each host and corresponding cuckoo gens can be categorized by two chromatic components of reflectance spectra and (2) there is a significant difference in a particular chroma component between hosts and the cuckoo. We suggest that the cuckoo parasitism in central Japan originated from parasitism on the black-faced bunting.

However, most models of recovery hinge on a direct reading of the fossil record, and several recent studies have suggested that the fossil record is especially incomplete for recovery intervals immediately after mass extinctions. Here, we analyze a database of genus occurrences for the paleocontinent of Laurentia to determine the effects of regional processes on recovery and the effects of variations in preservation and sampling intensity on perceived diversity trends and taxonomic rates during the Late Ordovician mass extinction and Early Silurian recovery. After accounting for variation in sampling intensity, we find that marine benthic diversity in Laurentia recovered to preextinction levels within 5 million years, which is nearly 15 million years sooner than suggested by global compilations. The rapid turnover in Laurentia suggests that processes such as immigration may have been particularly important in the recovery of regional ecosystems from environmental perturbations. However, additional regional studies and a global analysis of the Late Ordovician mass extinction that accounts for variations in sampling intensity are necessary to confirm this pattern. Because the record of Phanerozoic mass extinctions and postextinction recoveries may be compromised by variations in preservation and sampling intensity, all should be reevaluated with sampling-standardized analyses if the evolutionary role of mass extinctions is to be fully understood.},

	abstract = {1. According to the handicap principle of sexual selection, colourful ornaments honestly signal absolute quality only if they entail fitness costs. The degree of melanism often covaries positively with aspects of individual quality, and hence melanin-based coloration should be costly to produce or to maintain in a good shape. This is, however, unlikely because melanin-based coloration is often strongly heritable and in birds the rate of feather wear decreases with the amount of melanin pigments packed in feathers. 2. The hypothesis that melanin pigments reduce the cost of maintaining colourful ornaments in a good shape predicts a negative correlation between the degree of melanism and both the size of the uropygial gland that produces preening secretions and the intensity of preening behaviour. 3. Using a correlative approach, I evaluated these two predictions in the barn owl Tyto alba in which the body underside varies from immaculate to heavily marked with black spots, a eumelanin-based trait, and from white to reddish-brown, a phaeomelanin-based trait. I correlated plumage traits with preening behaviour in nestlings and with the size and mass of the uropygial gland in dead adults. I also weighed nonornamental wing and tail feathers to assess whether the quality of nonornamental feathers is positively correlated with the degree of melanism of an ornamental plumage trait. 4. The degree of phaeomelanism was neither associated with preening behaviour nor with the size and mass of the uropygial gland. In line with the two predictions, individuals with more and larger black spots had a lighter uropygial gland and preened less frequently. Because nonornamental wing and tail feathers of spottier individuals were heavier per unit of surface area, the entire plumage of eumelanic individuals may be more robust and in turn require less care than the plumage of nonmelanic conspecifics. 5. In conclusion, the degree of eumelanism can be associated with aspects of individual quality even if eumelanic ornaments are neither costly to produce nor to maintain in a good shape.},

Within the spongy layer of feather barbs, the number of circular keratin rods significantly predicted {UV}-violet chroma, whereas the standard error of the diameter of these rods significantly predicted spectral saturation.

Here, we review the pertinent literature, focusing on potential camouflage and mimicry. Webs are often difficult to detect in a heterogeneous visual environment. Static and dynamic web distortions are used to escape visual detection by prey, although particular silk may also attract prey. Recent work using physiological models of vision taking into account visual environments rarely supports the hypothesis of spider camouflage by decorations, but most often the prey attraction and predator confusion hypotheses. Similarly, visual modelling shows that spider coloration is effective in attracting prey but not in conveying camouflage. Camouflage through colour change might be used by particular crab spiders to hide from predator or prey on flowers of different coloration. However, results obtained on a non-cryptic crab spider suggest that an alternative function of pigmentation may be to avoid {UV} photodamage through the transparent cuticle. Numerous species are clearly efficient locomotory mimics of ants, particularly in the eyes of their predators. We close our paper by highlighting gaps in our knowledge.},

Also unusual is the yellow color exhibited by juveniles. Between 1992 and 1994, we captured adult and juvenile G. sila on the Elkhorn Plain, San Luis Obispo County, California, and scored individuals for their coloration. juvenile G. sila developed a yellow color on the undersides of their hind limbs and tail that was apparent when they were about 55 mm snout-vent length ({SVL}) and was prominent until about 85 to 90 mm {SVL}. Both males and females developed breeding colors between 85 and 95 mm {SVL}. Breeding colors of adults developed soon after they emerged each year in April or early May, and most adults retained breeding colors until they ended activity in July or August, although coloration fluctuated within a season for some individuals. Individual differences in the amount of coloration occurred with some large adults never developing fully bright breeding colors. Females produced multiple clutches in each year, and their breeding colors were not immediately apparent with their first clutch and sometimes faded, but did not disappear, between clutches.},

The cause was a brief glacial interval that produced two pulses of extinction. The first pulse was at the beginning of the glaciation, when sea-level decline drained epicontinental seaways, produced a harsh climate in low and mid-latitudes, and initiated active, deep-oceanic currents that aerated the deep oceans and brought nutrients and possibly toxic material up from oceanic depths. Following that initial pulse of extinction, surviving faunas adapted to the new ecologic setting. The glaciation ended suddenly, and as sea level rose, the climate moderated, and oceanic circulation stagnated, another pulse of extinction occurred. The second extinction marked the end of a long interval of ecologic stasis tan Ecologic-Evolutionary Unit). Recovery from the event took several million years, but the resulting fauna had ecologic patterns similar to the fauna that had become extinct. Other extinction events that eliminated similar or even smaller percentages of species had greater long-term ecologic effects.},

Laboratory and field behavioural experiments with swordtails (X. nigrensis) and predators (A. mexicanus) demonstrate that male {UV} ornamentation significantly increases their attractiveness to females but not to this predator, which is less sensitive to {UV}. {UV} reflectance among swordtail species correlates positively with tetra densities across habitats, and visual contrast estimates suggest that {UV} signals are highly conspicuous to swordtails in their natural environment. Cross–species comparisons also support the hypothesis that natural selection drives the use of {UV} communication. We compared two species, one with high (X. nigrensis) and one with low (X. malinche) Mexican tetra densities. Xiphophorus nigrensis males reflect significantly more {UV} than X. malinche, exhibit significant {UV} sexual dimorphism, and {UV} is a salient component of the sexual communication system. In X. malinche, however, males reflect minimally in the {UV}, there is no {UV} sexual dimorphism, and {UV} does not play a part in its communication system.},

Empirical studies show that some of these endosymbionts have the potential to influence sexual conflict not by sex-ratio distortion, but by altering reproductive traits within their hosts. Research has already shown that reproductive traits involved in mating/fertilization process are integral 'players' in sexual conflict, thus suggesting the novel hypothesis that endosymbiont-induced changes in reproductive phenotypes can impact the dynamics of sexual conflict. Here, we use a standard quantitative genetic approach to model the effects of endosymbiont-induced changes in a female reproductive trait on the dynamics of sexual conflict over mating/fertilization rate. Our model shows that an endosymbiont-induced alteration of a host female reproductive trait that affects mating rate can maintain the endosymbiont infection within the host population, and does so in the absence of sex-ratio distortion and cytoplasmic incompatibility.},

A wing mutation, "flatwing," eliminates the ability of {\textgreater}90\% of male field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) from one Hawaiian population to produce song to attract females. The morphological change was favored because calling is risky in Hawaii, attracting deadly parasitoid flies. An earlier study suggested that instead of calling, silent flatwing males use satellite behavior, approaching one of the few remaining callers and intercepting females attracted to them. Satellite-like behavior may have existed as a behavioral option prior to the wing mutation, accommodating the loss of singing ability, or behavior may have changed simultaneously with the spread of the mutation. In phonotaxis trials, males from different populations across the crickets' range varied in the distance at which they settled from the source of broadcast song, behaving more or less like satellites. Anecdotally, we noted satellite behavior in all populations, and importantly, males from the mutated population and its direct ancestor behaved similarly. This suggests that the alternative behavior is not strictly associated with the mutation and instead predated the change in morphology. We hypothesized further that satellite behavior may have been preexisting because it is beneficial under other circumstances, such as poor mating success. Virgin males did not show enhanced phonotaxis relative to multiply mated males, however. We conclude that satellite behavior predated the mutation in wing morphology, providing obligately silent males with an alternative method of locating mates and effectively rendering the wing mutation adaptive. Whereas mating history does not appear to influence phonotaxis behavior in males, other factors such as the acoustic environment and demographic conditions may be important contributors to behavioral decisions during male mate location.},

Most ladybirds possess a dotted pattern, althougn the number, shape, and size of the spots, as well as their colour, varies considerably. Almost all ladybirds have a characteristic general appearance (body shape). We considered these traits to be used in ladybird recognition by avian predators. In the present study, we compared the reactions of avian predators (Parus major) caught in the wild, to four differently coloured ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata, Exochomus quadripustulatus, Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata, and Cynegetis impunctata) and two artificial modifications of C. septempunctata; the first was deprived of their elytral spotted pattern by painting it brown, the other had their elytra removed (i.e. altering their general ladybird appearance). Ladybirds with a spotted pattern were attacked less frequently than unspotted ones. Ladybirds with removed elytra were attacked much more often than any ladybird with a preserved general appearance. The results obtained in the present study suggest the high importance of the spotted pattern as well as general appearance in the ladybird recognition process. Additional experiments with naive birds (hand-reared P. major) demonstrated the innateness of the aversion to two differently spotted ladybird species (C. septempunctata and Scymnus frontalis).

Yet, considerable intraspecific variation also occurs in many Anolis species. In Florida different populations of the Green Anole (Anolis carolinensis) exhibit red, pink, magenta, and even greenish-gray dewlaps. To date, comparisons of color variation in this species have used subjective techniques based on human color perception. Instead, we used an objective method-reflectance spectrometry-to quantify A. carolinensis dewlap and body color variation along a transect from northeastern to southwestern Florida. Reflectance readings of local vegetation allowed us to calculate contrast of the lizards with their visual backgrounds. By incorporating local ambient light and A. carolinensis spectral sensitivity into additional calculations, we were able to estimate lizard-background contrast from the perspective of the lizards. Results revealed dewlap and dorsum spectra to differ significantly among most of our study populations, as well as between the lizards and background vegetation. Although increased resemblance of a color signal to the illuminating spectrum will increase the signal's broadcast effectiveness, dewlap colors in our study populations did not resemble the ambient light spectra in their habitats. We consider the potential effects of this species' peculiar spectral sensitivity on the evolution of its dewlap coloration and propose that this coloration may represent a selective compromise to the unusually broad range of light habitats in which A. carolinensis is found. Last, the "gray throated" population of southwest Florida proved to be extraordinary, and we devote special attention to discussing aspects of coloration and contrast in this enigmatic population.},

	abstract = {The sex steroid testosterone has been shown to regulate the development of male-specific coloration in many organisms that exhibit sexual dichromatism, but the role of testosterone is less certain for species in which both sexes express bright coloration. Lizards in the genus Sceloporus possess bright blue patches on their throats and abdomens. These patches, which are used in social signaling, are often regulated by testosterone and are consequently expressed only in males of most species. However, Yarrow's Spiny Lizard (Sceloporus jarrovii, Cope 1875) exhibits a derived condition in which both sexes express bright blue ventral patches despite dramatic sexual differences in circulating testosterone levels throughout postnatal ontogeny. In this study, we used surgical castration and hormone replacement in juvenile males to test the hypothesis that testosterone stimulates the expression of blue ventral coloration in S. jarrovii. In two separate experiments conducted in captivity and the natural field environment, we found that surgical castration decreased the hue and saturation while increasing the brightness of blue throat and abdominal patches. Castration also decreased the amount of black pigment bordering the blue throat patch. Treatment of castrated males with exogenous testosterone restored all aspects of ventral coloration to values similar to those of intact control males. Early organizational effects of testosterone during prenatal development may lead to the expression of blue coloration in both sexes, but the results of our present experiments indicate that subsequent effects of testosterone during sexual maturation further enhance the coloration of males.

However, whether variation in circulating carotenoid levels causes variation in both immune function and sexual attractiveness has not been determined in any species.

Thus, the presence of ornamentation among males in many monogamous bird species presents something of a conundrum. Under certain conditions, extra-pair paternity can increase the variance in reproductive success among males, thus increasing the potential for sexual selection to act. We addressed this possibility in the mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides), a socially monogamous songbird in which males possess brilliant ultraviolet ({UV})-blue plumage. Specifically, we asked whether a male's success at siring offspring within his own nest and within the nests of other males was related to his coloration. In pairwise comparisons, males that sired extra-pair offspring were not more colorful than the males that they cuckolded. However, males that sired at least one extra-pair offspring were, on average, brighter and more {UV}-blue than males that did not sire extra-pair offspring. Brighter, more {UV}-blue males sired more offspring both with their own mate and tended to sire more offspring with extra-pair mates and thus sired more offspring overall. Our results support the hypothesis that the brilliant {UV}-blue ornamental plumage of male mountain bluebirds evolved at least in part because it provides males with an advantage in fertilizing the eggs of multiple females.},

	abstract = {The developmental stress hypothesis offers a mechanism to maintain honesty of sexually selected ornaments, because only high quality individuals will be able to develop full ornamentation in the face of stress during early development. Experimental tests of this hypothesis have traditionally involved the manipulation of one aspect of the rearing conditions and an examination of effects on adult traits. Here, we instead use a statistically powerful quantitative genetic approach to detect condition dependence. We use animal models to estimate environmental correlations between a measure of early growth and adult traits. This way, we could make use of the sometimes dramatic differences in early growth of more than 800 individually cross-fostered birds and measure the effect on a total of 23 different traits after birds reached maturity. We find strong effects of environmental growth conditions on adult body size, body mass and fat deposition, moderate effects on beak colour in both sexes, but no effect on song and plumage characters. Rather surprisingly, there was no effect on male attractiveness, both measured in mate choice trials and under socially complex conditions in aviaries. There was a trend for a positive effect of good growth conditions on the success at fertilizing eggs in males breeding in aviaries whereas longevity was not affected in either sex. We conclude that zebra finches are remarkably resilient to food shortage during growth and can compensate for poor growth conditions without much apparent life-history trade-offs. Our results do not support the hypothesis that sexually selected traits show heightened condition dependence compared to nonsexually selected traits.},

These analyses support the use of linear models for ordinal ranked data on threat status, and phylogenetic generalized linear models revealed a significant positive correlation between current extinction risk and body mass across our tree block. We then investigated historical patterns of speciation and extinction rates using a recently developed maximum-likelihood method. Specifically, we predicted that body mass correlates positively with extinction rate because larger bodied organisms reproduce more slowly, and body mass correlates negatively with speciation rate because smaller bodied organisms are better able to partition niche space. We failed to find evidence that extinction rates covary with body mass across primate phylogeny. Similarly, the speciation rate was generally unrelated to body mass, except in some tests that indicated an increase in the speciation rate with increasing body mass. Importantly, we discovered that our data violated a key assumption of sample randomness with respect to body mass. After correcting for this bias, we found no association between diversification rates and mass.},

Although animal coloration has received considerable attention, little work has addressed the quantitative genetics of color variation in natural populations. We investigated the quantitative genetics of a carotenoid-based color patch, the ventral plumage of mature great tits (Parus major), in a wild population. Carotenoid-based colors are often suggested to reflect environmental variation in carotenoid availability, but numerous mechanisms could also lead to genetic variation in coloration. Analyses of individuals of known origin showed that, although plumage chromaticity (i.e., color) was moderately heritable, there was no significant heritability to achromaticity (i.e., brightness). We detected multiple long-lasting effects of natal environment, with hatching date and brood size both negatively related to plumage chromaticity at maturity. Our reflectance measures contrasted in their spatiotemporal sensitivity, with plumage chromaticity exhibiting significant spatial variation and achromatic variation exhibiting marked annual variation. Hence, color variation in this species reflects both genetic and environmental influences on different scales. Our analyses demonstrate the context dependence of components of color variation and suggest that color patches may convey multiple aspects of individual state.},

However, little is known about evolutionary changes in carotenoid coloration, especially among closely related species. We used a phylogenetic perspective to examine carotenoid color changes within New World orioles (genus Icterus). Oriole color was quantitatively measured using reflectance spectrometry. We found continuous variation from short- to long-wavelength carotenoid colors in extant orioles-perceived by humans as ranging from yellow to scarlet-suggesting that these carotenoid-based colors have evolved as a continuous character. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that short- and long-wavelength carotenoid colors have evolved independently multiple times, likely from a middle-wavelength ancestor. Although color showed considerable lability, we found a significant amount of phylogenetic signal across the entire genus. This implies that while labile, the colors of closely related taxa tended to resemble each other more than would be expected due to chance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use quantitative character states derived from reflectance spectra in ancestral state reconstruction. Reflectance spectra provide an unbiased quantitative description of color that allowed us to detect subtle changes among closely related taxa. Using these quantitative methods to score and reconstruct color changes among closely related taxa provides a better understanding of how elaborate animal colors evolve.},

	abstract = {Background: Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria that are frequently found in arthropods and nematodes. These maternally inherited bacteria manipulate host reproduction by several mechanisms including cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}). {CI} is the most common phenotype induced by Wolbachia and results in the developmental arrest of embryos derived from crosses between Wolbachia-infected males and uninfected females. Although the molecular mechanisms of {CI} are currently unknown, several studies suggest that host sperm is modified by Wolbachia during spermatogenesis. Results: We compared the gene expression of Drosophila melanogaster larval testes with and without the {wMel} strain of Wolbachia to identify candidate genes that could be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and the insect host. Microarray, quantitative {RT}-{PCR} and in situ hybridization analyses were carried out on D. melanogaster larval testes to determine the effect of Wolbachia infection on host gene expression. A total of 296 genes were identified by microarray analysis to have at least a 1.5 fold change [q-value {\textless} 5\%] in expression. When comparing Wolbachia-infected flies to uninfected flies, 167 genes were up-regulated and 129 genes down-regulated. Differential expression of genes related to metabolism, immunity, reproduction and other functions were observed. Quantitative {RT}-{PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) confirmed 12 genes are differentially expressed in the testes of the 3rd instar larvae of Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Wolbachia infection changes the expression of several genes putatively associated with spermatogenesis including {JH} induced protein-26 and Mst84Db, or involved in immune (kenny) or metabolism ({CG}4988-{RA}). Conclusions: Wolbachia change the gene expression of 296 genes in the larval testes of D. melanogaster including genes related to metabolism, immunity and reproduction. Interestingly, most of the genes putatively involved in immunity were up-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. In contrast, most of the genes putatively associated with reproduction (especially spermatogenesis) were down-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. These results suggest Wolbachia may activate the immune pathway but inhibit spermatogenesis. Our data provide a significant panel of candidate genes that may be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and their insect hosts. This forms a basis to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Wolbachia-induced {CI} in Drosophila and the influence of Wolbachia on spermatogenesis.},

If variation in carotenoid ingestion underlies variation in carotenoid-based colour expression, then carotenoid-supplemented birds should have reduced variance in colour. In this study, carotenoid supplementation produced a small but significant change in plumage colouration, but no significant change in variation. These results suggest that variation in carotenoid acquisition is not an important source of variation for this colour trait, and that variation in post-ingestion processes are likely to be more important. The low heritability of this colour trait suggests environmental factors are likely to underlie the majority of variation in these processes.},

These colours are often exaggerated in males, which suggests a sexually selected origin. We studied the visual properties, morphological basis, and interindividual variation of structural wing colouration in the common eggfly, Hypolimnas bolina L. (Nymphalidae). Males of this territorial species possess highly directional {UV}/violet colouration that fully overlaps smaller white patches on their dorsal wing surfaces. We sampled 56 males, including territorial residents and non-resident ‘floaters’ and assessed the properties of their structural colour using reflectance spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy. The patches reflect strongly in the {UV} range (300–400 nm), with a peak of {\textasciitilde}360 nm, and the wing scales in these regions exhibit a ridge-lamellar surface architecture that has known function in other species as a multiple thin-film interference mirror. Peak {UV} brightness was variable, and both brightness and peak hue varied systematically across age classes. {UV} brightness was also related to hue independently of the age-related variation. Territorial residents possessed duller {UV} markings than their non-resident contemporaries, which is not consistent with exaggeration due to male–male competition. The high phenotypic variance is, however, consistent with a putative role for this male-limited trait as a sexual ornament.},

We employed different flower-well depths to vary handling times (costs), and differences in sucrose molarity to vary reward quality. Tests were performed with 2 and 6 mu l rewards to vary quantity. We show that when handling time is correlated with flower-colour morphs on a pedicellate artificial flower patch, a honeybee's foraging behaviour is dependent on the flower colours used in the choice tests. This supports a honeybee foraging model where constraints are a significant factor in decision making. Bees visiting blue-yellow flower patches exhibited flower constancy to colour, where they restricted most visits to a single flower colour, some bees to blue and others to yellow, irrespective of handing time differences. When offered a choice of equally rewarding blue or white flowers, bees were not constrained by flower colour and chose to visit flowers with a lower handling time. When reward molarity varied with well depth between blue and white flowers, foragers chose shallow-well flowers (short-handling time) with a smaller net harvest rate over deep-well flowers (long-handling time) with a greater net harvest rate. Results using the blue-white dimorphic flower patch suggest that when foraging options simultaneously involve reward and handling-time choices, honeybee forager behaviour is inconsistent with an absolute method of evaluating profit.},

The trained butterflies were tested on their ability to perceive brightness in two different protocols: (i) two orange discs of different intensity presented on the same intensity grey background and (ii) two orange discs of the same intensity separately presented on a grey background that was either higher or lower in intensity than the training background. The butterflies trained to high intensity red selected the orange disc of high intensity in protocol 1, and the disc on the background of low intensity grey in protocol 2. We obtained similar results in another set of experiments with purple discs instead of orange discs. The choices of the butterflies trained to low intensity red were opposite to those just described. Taken together, we conclude that Papilio has the ability to learn brightness and darkness of targets independent of colour, and that they have the so-called simultaneous brightness contrast.},

High developmental stability is considered to result in low {FA}, and to be associated with high quality. Individuals of high quality are predicted to produce sexually selected traits that are large and symmetrical, at a relatively low cost. In this study, we manipulated eyespot development to uncouple eyespot size and {FA} in order to examine their independent roles in signalling to the female. Individual females in cages were given the choice between two or three males differing in eyespot traits. The results indicate that although size per se of the eyespots is used as a signal, {FA} and wing size are not. We discuss the use of {FA} in studies of sexual selection and aspects of sexual selection on dorsal eyespot size.},

	abstract = {This article offers tips for managers on selecting and implementing a profitable and effective green marketing strategy. In a 2002 Roper survey, 41 percent of consumers said they did not buy green products because they worried about the diminished quality of eco-friendly versions. And both Procter \& Gamble Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have been criticized for selling a brand of paper towels labeled as green in which the inner tube was made of recycled paper but the towels themselves were made of chlorine-bleached unrecycled paper and came packaged in plastic. Companies must always keep in mind that consumers are unlikely to compromise on traditional product attributes, such as convenience, availability, price, quality and performance. In other words, green products must match up on those attributes against nongreen products in order to earn consideration from the vast majority of consumers. It is even more important to realize, however, that there is no single green marketing strategy that is right for every company. The strategies that should work best under different market and competitive conditions range from the relatively passive and silent lean green approach to the more aggressive and visible extreme green approach, with defensive green and shaded green in between. Managers who understand these strategies and the underlying reasoning behind them will be better prepared to help their companies benefit from an environmentally friendly approach to marketing.},

	abstract = {High-temperature origin-of-life theories require that the components of the first genetic material are stable. We therefore have measured the half-lives for the decomposition of the nucleobases. They have been found to be short on the geologic time scale. At 100 degrees C, the growth temperatures of the hyperthermophiles, the half-lives are too short to allow for the adequate accumulation of these compounds (t(1/2) for A and G approximate to 1 yr; U = 12 yr; C = 19 days). Therefore, unless the origin of life took place extremely rapidly ({\textless}100 yr), we conclude that a high-temperature origin of life may be possible, but it cannot involve adenine, uracil, guanine, or cytosine, The rates of hydrolysis at 100 degrees C also suggest that an ocean-boiling asteroid impact would reset the prebiotic clock, requiring prebiotic synthetic processes to begin again, At 0 degrees C, A, U, G, and T appear to be sufficiently stable (t(1/2) greater than or equal to 10(6) yr) to be involved in a low-temperature origin of life. However, the lack of stability of cytosine at 0 degrees C (t(1/2) = 17,000 yr) raises the possibility that the {GC} base pair may not have been used in the first genetic material unless life arose quickly ({\textless}10(6) yr) after a sterilization event.

Here, we provide evidence for sex-specific morphological and colour differences in the strikingly patterned but apparently monomorphic Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata). We found that males had longer and darker tails, wider lores and a darker bill, while females had significantly more white flank spots. These gender-specific trait differences could be used to signal individual quality in sexual or social interactions, and hence we examined the correlation between these traits and the cell-mediated immune response (phytohaemagglutinin, {PHA} test). During both the breeding and non-breeding seasons, we found a positive correlation between {PHA} response and white flank spot number as well as their ultra-violet reflectance in females, and a negative correlation with white chroma and hue. In males, there was a positive correlation between {PHA} response and red rump reflectance (hue, red-chroma). There was no association between {PHA} response and either tail length or lore depth in either sex. These results add to a growing body of evidence that female spot number and white plumage reflectance signal quality.},

This is not just true when compared across species and contexts, but also between intraspecific displays of very similar function, such as threat displays. General biases in recognition mechanisms may be responsible for this effect. Previous artificial neural network simulations have demonstrated that perceptual biases in the receiver may cause a coevolving signal to polarize away from another, non-evolving, stimulus. In this paper we extend this work by investigating networks which respond differently to several different stimuli. We show that two relevant signals, ideally producing different responses, also evolve towards converse forms despite being processed through the same network. We found no evidence that attractive signals share common attractive properties. Our results can not be accounted for by existing strategic models of communication.},

We hypothesize that milli-scale modifications of feathers produce anisotropic reflectance, the direction of which may be predicted by the orientation of the milli-scale structure. The subject of this study is the African Emerald Cuckoo, Chrysococcyx cupreus, noted for its shimmering green iridescent appearance. Using a spherical gantry, we measured the change in the directional reflectance across the feather surface and over a hemisphere of incident lighting directions. Using a {microCT} scanner, we also studied the morphology of the structural branches of the barb. We tracked the changes in the directional reflectance to the orientation of the structural branches as observed in the {CT} data. We conclude that (i) the far-field signal of the feather consists of multiple specular components, each associated with a different structural branch and (ii) the direction of each specular component is correlated to the orientation of the corresponding structure.},

	abstract = {One Darwinian puzzle is that many prey are morphologically or behaviourally conspicuous. Being conspicuous seems detrimental to prey with limited antipredator ability, because conspicuousness is likely to increase detection by predators. Theory predicts that if conspicuousness effectively redirects predator attacks and decreases hunting success, the benefits of enhanced survival can outweigh the cost of conspicuousness. We investigated a conspicuous antipredator behaviour in the orb spider, Cyclosa mulmeinensis, which adds decorations composed of prey pellets and eggsacs to its web. We calculated colour contrasts of spiders against prey pellets and eggsacs and recorded predators' responses to spiders on webs in the field. Webs with more decorations suffered increased numbers of wasp attacks. However because these decorations resembled spiders in size and colour, they functioned as decoys to distract predators and became the focus of predator attacks. By quantifying the costs and benefits of Cyclosa spiders' web-decorating behaviour in a natural setting, we found that this conspicuous antipredator display would enhance overall survival and was adaptive for this vulnerable prey.

The relationships between carotenoid-based coloration, circulating carotenoids and body condition have been well studied in adult birds, but little is known in nestlings. Here, we investigated variations in carotenoid-based coloration in a raptor nestling, the Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), both in captivity and in natural conditions, and within a vole (poor-carotenoid source and cyclic prey) specialist population. We studied these variations according to nestling age and sex, and possible limitations in carotenoid availability by comparing years of contrasted prey abundance and using carotenoid supplementation experiments. Captive nestlings, fed only with mice, were strongly carotenoid limited. Wild nestlings were also carotenoid limited, especially in a year of high vole abundance. Nestlings were in better condition but less colored during a peak vole abundance year than during a low vole abundance year, when harriers targeted more alternative preys (birds, insects). Thus, variation in vole abundance resulted in a de-coupling of body condition and carotenoid-based coloration in this population. This suggested that the positive relation between the body condition and carotenoid-based traits, typically found in adult birds, could be restricted to adults or nestlings of species that feed on carotenoid-rich food. Our results should stimulate more work on the functions and mechanisms of carotenoid-based traits in nestlings, which deserve more attention and most likely differ from those of adult birds.},

	abstract = {Previous discussions of mass extinction mechanisms generally focused on circumstances unique to each event. However, some have proposed that extensive volcanism combined with bolide impact may offer a general mechanism of mass extinction. To test this hypothesis we compared generic extinction percentages for 73 stages or substages of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. We found that the highest frequency of intervals with elevated extinction occurred when continental flood basalt volcanism and bolide impact co-occurred. In contrast, neither volcanism nor impact alone yielded statistically elevated extinction frequencies. Although the magnitude of extinction was un-correlated with the size of the associated flood basalt or impact structure, crater diameter did correlate with extinction percentage when volcanism and impact coincided. Despite this result, case-by-case analysis showed that the volcanism-impact hypothesis alone cannot explain all intervals of elevated extinction. Continental flood volcanism and impact share important ecological features with other proposed extinction mechanisms. Impacts, like marine anoxic incursions, are pulse disturbances that are sudden and catastrophic, and cause extensive mortality. Volcanism, like climate and sea level change, is a press disturbance that alters community composition by placing multi-generational stress on ecosystems. We propose that the coincidence of press and pulse events, not merely volcanism and impact, is required to produce the greatest episodes of dying in Phanerozoic history.},

Previously we established a homozygous melanic strain ({JBM}) with 16 black pupae spontaneously occurring within a laboratory population ({JBW}) of Helicoverpa armigera and demonstrated that the melanisation is controlled by a single recessive autosomal gene. 2. Data obtained indicate that the melanisation is globally expressed in the pupal and adult stages (except for the body hairs of adults) but not in the egg and larval stages. No differences in body colour can be found between the melanic {JBM} and the wild-type {JBW} strains before the metamorphic pupation moult. After pupation, the {JBM} pupae gradually blacken, whereas the wild-type {JBW} pupae gradually turn brown, indicating that the biosynthetic steps leading to brown pigments are shut off in the {JBM} strain. In the adult stage, wings are darker and hairs on the abdomen and tergum are lighter in the melanic moths than in the wild-type individuals. 3. Life-table experiments reveal that the melanism is associated with slower development in all life stages, smaller body weight, lower mating rate and fecundity, less mating time, and accordingly, lower net reproduction rate and population trend index. 4. Single pair inbreeding and reciprocal crosses show that the mating rate is much lower in the inter-strain crosses than in the intra-strain crosses, indicating the presence of mating preference for its own colour morph and the presence to some degree of reproductive isolation between the two colour morphs.},

We evaluated the incidence of cancer among pesticide applicators exposed to chlorpyrifos in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Methods: A total of 54 383 pesticide applicators were included in this analysis. Detailed information on pesticide exposure and lifestyle factors was obtained from self-administered questionnaires completed at the time of enrollment (December 1993–December 1997). Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between chlorpyrifos exposure and cancer incidence after adjustment for potential confounders. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: A total of 2070 incident malignant neoplasms were diagnosed through 2001. The rate ratio for all cancers combined among chlorpyrifos-exposed applicators compared with nonexposed applicators was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval = 0.87 to 1.08). For most cancers analyzed, there was no evidence of an exposure–response relationship. However, the incidence of lung cancer was statistically significantly associated with both chlorpyrifos lifetime exposure-days (Ptrend = .002) and chlorpyrifos intensity-weighted exposure-days (Ptrend = .036). After adjustment for other pesticide exposures and demographic factors, individuals in the highest quartile of chlorpyrifos lifetime exposure-days ({\textgreater}56 days) had a relative risk of lung cancer 2.18 (95\% confidence interval = 1.31 to 3.64) times that of those with no chlorpyrifos exposure. Conclusion: Our findings suggest an association between chlorpyrifos use and incidence of lung cancer that deserves further evaluation.},

	abstract = {When faced with changing environments, organisms rapidly mount physiological and behavioural responses, accommodating new environmental inputs in their functioning. The ubiquity of this process contrasts with our ignorance of its evolutionary significance: whereas within-generation accommodation of novel external inputs has clear fitness consequences, current evolutionary theory cannot easily link functional importance and inheritance of novel accommodations. One hundred and twelve years ago, J.M. Baldwin, H.F. Osborn and C.L. Morgan proposed a process (later termed the Baldwin effect) by which non-heritable developmental accommodation of novel inputs, which makes an organism fit in its current environment, can become internalized in a lineage and affect the course of evolution. The defining features of this process are initial overproduction of random (with respect to fitness) developmental variation, followed by within-generation accommodation of a subset of this variation by developmental or functional systems ('organic selection'), ensuring the organism's fit and survival. Subsequent natural selection sorts among resultant developmental variants, which, if recurrent and consistently favoured, can be inherited when existing genetic variance includes developmental components of individual modifications or when the ability to accommodate novel inputs is itself heritable. Here, I show that this process is consistent with the origin of novel adaptations during colonization of North America by the house finch. The induction of developmental variation by novel environments of this species's expanding range was followed by homeostatic channelling, phenotypic accommodation and directional cross-generational transfer of a subset of induced developmental outcomes favoured by natural selection. These results emphasize three principal points. First, contemporary novel adaptations result mostly from reorganization of existing structures that shape newly expressed variation, giving natural selection an appearance of a creative force. Second, evolutionary innovations and maintenance of adaptations are different processes. Third, both the Baldwin and parental effects are probably a transient state in an evolutionary cycle connecting initial phenotypic retention of adaptive changes and their eventual genetic determination and, thus, the origin of adaptation and evolutionary change.},

Female preference is known to have a strong genetic component. We test whether the specialist and generalist populations form respective genetic clusters using data from mitochondrial sequences and 10 microsatellite loci. Results do not support this hypothesis, suggesting that the specialist and generalist traits have evolved more than once independently. Mitochondrial {DNA} variation suggests a rapid expansion scenario, with a single widespread haplotype occurring in high frequency, whereas microsatellite data indicate strong differentiation of the Moroccan population. Based on a comparison of polymorphism in the mitochondrial data and sequences from a nuclear gene, we show that the diversity in the former is significantly less than that expected under neutral evolution. Furthermore, we found that almost all butterfly samples were infected with a single strain of Wolbachia, a maternally inherited bacterium. We reason that indirect selection on the mitochondrial genome mediated by a recent sweep of Wolbachia infection has depleted variability in the mitochondrial sequences. We also surmise that P. c-album could have expanded out of a single glacial refugium and colonized Morocco recently.},

A number of such structures have been identified in butterfly scales, including three variations on a simple multi-layer structure. In this study, we optically characterize examples of all three types of multi-layer structure, as found in 10 species. The optical mechanism of the suppression and exaggeration of the angle-dependent optical properties (iridescence) of these structures is described. In addition, we consider the phylogeny of the butterflies, and are thus able to relate the optical properties of the structures to their evolutionary development. By applying two different types of analysis, the mechanism of adaptation is addressed. A simple parsimony analysis, in which all evolutionary changes are given an equal weighting, suggests convergent evolution of one structure. A Dollo parsimony analysis, in which the evolutionary ‘cost’ of losing a structure is less than that of gaining it, implies that ‘latent’ structures can be reused.},

Selection for efficient signal perception should favor the evolution of traits that exhibit an optimal balance between these two design components. We examined the evolution of signal design in the colorful plumage ornaments of manakins (Aves: Pipridae). We used a model of avian color space to quantify how differences in plumage coloration would be perceived by a typical passerine bird and examined patterns of coloration across 50 species of manakin. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we show that plumage contrast against the background increases with sexual dichromatism in males but not females, suggesting that sexual selection has favored the evolution of male plumage ornaments that enhance signal efficacy. Plumage contrast within individuals also increased with dichromatism in males but not females. Finally, plumage colors produced by different mechanisms, which may reveal different aspects of quality, resulted in different degrees of contrast against the background. Our findings suggest that selection for signal efficacy and content may sometimes be opposing, creating a trade‐off between these two components of signal design. Manakins may mediate this trade‐off by combining multiple plumage ornaments that differ in efficacy and content.},

Female three–spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in many populations show a mating preference for males with a red throat and jaw. It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females in accordance with the Fisher–Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female three–spined and nine–spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context. This result demonstrates a correlation between a sexually selected trait and an intrinsic attraction to red objects, and supports the sensory–exploitation model for the evolution of red nuptial coloration in three–spined sticklebacks.},

The two strains were identified by sequencing a fragment of wsp (a major surface protein gene), amplified by polymerase chain reaction from {DNA} extracted from the body parts of individual sandflies. Infection rates were high in the males and females of both sandflies, but they were lower for the B-group {wPrn} strain of Wolbachia in Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead (60.3\% overall) than for the A-group {wPap} strain in P. papatasi (Scopoli) (81.7\%). Infections were frequent in the thorax, where Leishmania develops infective forms, as well as in the abdomen, where Wolbachia must infect the reproductive tissues to ensure its vertical transmission. These findings were related to knowledge of the population biology of Wolbachia in other insects, leading to the conclusion that this endosymbiont could be useful for driving transgenes through wild populations of both sandflies. This will require characterizing the cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotypes of Wolbachia-sandfly combinations, as well as estimating for them the incidence of paternal transmission and the fidelity of maternal transmission. Paternal transmission is one explanation for finding a single Wolbachia strain associated with all mitochondrial haplotypes and lineages of each sandfly species. However, this distribution pattern could also result from multiple horizontal transmissions or the failure of wsp to provide strain markers.},

We used great and blue tits (Parus major and Cyanistes caeruleus), comprising closely related and ecologically similar bird species differing in body size, as experimental predators. Two larval instars and adults of the unpalatable red firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus), differing in body size and/or coloration, were used as prey. We showed that prey body size did not influence whether a predator attacked the prey or not during the first encounter. However, smaller prey were attacked, killed, and eaten more frequently in repetitive encounters. We assumed that body size influences the predator through the amount of repellent chemicals better than through the amount of optical warning signal. The larger predator attacked, killed and ate all forms of firebug more often than the smaller one. The difference between both predators was more pronounced in less protected forms of firebug (chemically as well as optically). Colour pattern also substantially affected the willingness of predators to attack the prey. Larval red black coloration did not provide a full-value warning signal, although a similarly conspicuous red-black coloration of the adults reliably protected them.

	abstract = {1. Oxidative stress may provide a proximate link between investment in growth and/or reproduction and investment in self-maintenance. Dietary antioxidants, such as carotenoids and vitamin E, provide potentially important roles in regulating these trade-offs. Recent work suggests that carotenoids may have synergistic effects in combination with non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E) on the expression of sexually selected traits in adulthood. However, these studies involved the supplementation of antioxidants to adults so did not take account of early life-history effects. 2. Here, we test the independent and combined roles of supplementation of carotenoids and vitamin E during early growth in regulating the expression of traits in adulthood, in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus. Individuals supplemented with a combination of carotenoids and vitamin E were larger at adulthood than individuals receiving other treatment diets (including vitamin E or carotenoids alone), but there were no differences in ornament expression, immune function, the swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin or levels of oxidative damage. 3. This shows that there are synergistic early life-history effects of these dietary antioxidants on body size at adulthood and suggest that the allocation of limited antioxidant resources are prioritized towards traits that increase competitive ability rather than sexual attractiveness in this strongly sexually selected species.},

	abstract = {Perception of the body's outline and three-dimensional shape arises from visual cues such as shading, contour, perspective and texture. When a uniformly coloured prey animal is illuminated from above by sunlight, a shadow may be cast on the body, generating a brightness contrast between the dorsal and ventral surfaces. For animals such as caterpillars, which live among flat leaves, a difference in reflectance over the body surface may degrade the degree of background matching and provide cues to shape from shading. This may make otherwise cryptic prey more conspicuous to visually hunting predators. Cryptically coloured prey are expected to match their substrate in colour, pattern and texture ( though disruptive patterning is an exception), but they may also abolish self-shadowing and therefore either reduce shape cues or maintain their degree of background matching through countershading: a gradation of pigment on the body of an animal so that the surface closest to illumination is darker. In this study, we report the results from a series of field experiments where artificial prey resembling lepidopteran larvae were presented on the upper surfaces of beech tree branches so that they could be viewed by free-living birds. We demonstrate that countershading is superior to uniform coloration in terms of reducing attack by free-living predators. This result persisted even when we fixed prey to the underside of branches, simulating the resting position of many tree-living caterpillars. Our experiments provide the first demonstration, in an ecologically valid visual context, that shadowing on bodies (such as lepidopteran larvae) provides cues that visually hunting predators use to detect potential prey species, and that countershading counterbalances shadowing to enhance cryptic protection.},

The coloration of mouthparts of nestlings can influence adult care and, thus, the polymorphism of yellow or white rictal flanges among nestling Brown-headed Cowbirds may reflect differential success with different hosts on the basis of flange color. Moreover, because Brown-headed Cowbirds in the southern United States co-occur with Bronzed Cowbirds (M. aeneus), whose young have white flanges, cowbird nestlings' flange colors may reflect a means for reducing interspecific competition through partitioning of host species on the basis of nestling flange color. To determine whether flange color influences cowbird fledging success with hosts of either color, we recorded the flange colors of cowbirds and their hosts at a site in Texas. We also tested whether flange color was influenced by nestling sex. Most hosts of Brown-headed Cowbirds had young with yellow flanges (81\%, n = 16 spp.), yet Brown-headed Cowbirds with white flanges were more common (61\%, n = 107). Bronzed Cowbirds parasitized primarily species whose young had white flanges (86\%, n = 348 eggs). Despite the differential use of hosts with regard to flange color, the frequencies of each were similar among nestling and juvenile Brown-headed Cowbirds. Likewise, the frequencies of each color did not differ significantly between the sexes. Therefore, we suggest that a flange color matching that of nestmates is not strongly selected for by hosts.},

	abstract = {Tradeoffs occur between a variety of traits in a diversity of organisms, and these tradeoffs can have major effects on ecological and evolutionary processes. Far less is known, however, about tradeoffs between male traits that affect mate attraction than about tradeoffs between other types of traits. Previous results indicate that females of the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, prefer male songs with higher chirp rates and longer chirp durations. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a tradeoff between these traits affects the evolution of male song. The two traits were negatively correlated among full-sibling families, consistent with a genetically based tradeoff, and the tradeoff was stronger when nutrients were limiting. In addition, for males from 12 populations reared in a common environment, the traits were negatively correlated within populations, the strength of the tradeoff was largely invariant across populations, and the within-population tradeoff predicted how the traits have evolved among populations. A widespread tradeoff thus affects male trait evolution. Finally, for males from four populations assayed in the field, the traits were negatively correlated within and among populations. The tradeoff is thus robust to the presence of environmental factors that might mask its effects. Together, our results indicate there is a fundamental tradeoff between male traits that: (i) limits the ability of males to produce multiple attractive traits; (ii) limits how male traits evolve; and (iii) might favour plasticity in female mating preferences.},

	abstract = {Signals used to attract mates are often conspicuous to predators and parasites, and their evolution via sexual selection is expected to be opposed by viability selection. Many secondary sexual traits may represent a compromise between attractiveness and avoidance of detection. Although such signal exploitation appears to be widespread, most examples come from species that use acoustic or olfactory mating signals, and relatively few cases of visual signal exploitation can be substantiated. Because males are usually the signaling sex, they are more at risk from predators or parasitoids that locate prey or hosts by sexual signals; this differential selection on the two sexes can affect the intensity of sexual selection on male ornamental traits. The notable exception to male signaling and female attraction occurs in pheromone-producing insects, particularly lepidopterans, which show an opposite pattern of female odor production. Exploitation of such sex pheromones is relatively rare. We discuss reasons for the reversal in sex roles in these species and its implications for signal exploitation. Changes in signals that appear to be adaptations to avoid predation include the use of different signal modalities, changes in signaling behavior, loss of signals, and alteration of signal characteristics such as pitch. Selection pressure from signal exploiters could lead to the production of a novel signal and thus facilitate speciation. Relatively little work has been done on adaptations on the part of the exploiting species, but such adaptations could indirectly influence the mating system of the predator or parasitoid. Signal exploitation is also expected to be a fruitful source of examples of coevolution. Finally, plants emit attractants analogous to secondary sex characters in animals, and may also be vulnerable to signal exploitation.},

	abstract = {Insect wings demonstrate elaborate three-dimensional deformations and kinematics. These deformations are key to understanding many aspects of insect flight including aerodynamics, structural dynamics and control. In this paper, we propose a template-based subdivision surface reconstruction method that is capable of reconstructing the wing deformations and kinematics of free-flying insects based on the output of a high-speed camera system. The reconstruction method makes no rigid wing assumptions and allows for an arbitrary arrangement of marker points on the interior and edges of each wing. The resulting wing surfaces are projected back into image space and compared with expert segmentations to validate reconstruction accuracy. A least squares plane is then proposed as a universal reference to aid in making repeatable measurements of the reconstructed wing deformations. Using an Eastern pondhawk (Erythimus simplicicollis) dragonfly for demonstration, we quantify and visualize the wing twist and camber in both the chord-wise and span-wise directions, and discuss the implications of the results. In particular, a detailed analysis of the subtle deformation in the dragonfly's right hindwing suggests that the muscles near the wing root could be used to induce chord-wise camber in the portion of the wing nearest the specimen's body. We conclude by proposing a novel technique for modeling wing corrugation in the reconstructed flapping wings. In this method, displacement mapping is used to combine wing surface details measured from static wings with the reconstructed flapping wings, while not requiring any additional information be tracked in the high speed camera output.},

	abstract = {The manipulation of egg content is one of the few ways by which female birds can alter offspring quality before hatch. Lipid-soluble vitamins and carotenoids are potent antioxidants. Female birds deposit these antioxidants into eggs in variable amounts according to environmental and social conditions, and the quantities deposited into eggs can have effects on offspring health and immunological condition. Allocation theory posits that females will alter the distribution of resources according to mate quality, sometimes allocating resources according to the differential allocation hypothesis ({DAH}), investing more in offspring sired by better-quality males, and other times allocating resources according to a compensatory strategy, enhancing the quality of offspring sired by lower-quality males. It is unknown, however, whether antioxidants are deposited into eggs according to the {DAH} or a compensatory strategy. We examined deposition patterns of yolk antioxidants (including vitamin E and three carotenoids) in relation to laying order, mate attractiveness, female condition, and yolk androgen content in the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). Female house finches deposited significantly more total antioxidants into eggs sired by less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidant content was significantly positively correlated with female condition, which suggests a cost associated with the deposition of antioxidants into eggs. Finally, concentrations of antioxidants in egg yolks were positively correlated with total yolk androgen content. We suggest that yolk antioxidants are deposited according to a compensatory deposition strategy, enabling females to improve the quality of young produced with less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidants may act to counter some of the detrimental effects associated with high levels of yolk androgens in eggs and, thus, may exert a complementary effect to yolk androgens.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic coloration in animals is often expected to have a signalling function, but it may also evolve as a correlated trait that reflects life-history strategy, social strategy, or ecological divergence. Wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) exhibit substantial colour variation, with both males and females being red, white, yellow, or a mixture of these colours. However, the biological significance of these colour morphs remains unknown. Here we investigate the relationship between coloration and temperature-dependent locomotor performance in an attempt to identify the adaptive significance of colour variation in this species. We investigate the maximum sprint speed of males and females of each of these colour morphs across seven different temperatures, using general additive mixed models ({GAMMs}). We predicted that the different sexes and colour phenotypes would exhibit differences in sprint speed performance, potentially indicating a correlation between coloration and adaptation into different ecological niches. We found no difference in performance of the discrete colour morphs, but amongst individuals that exhibited red coloration, those with a greater percentage of red were slower than those with less red coloration. This suggests a trade-off between red coloration and high sprint performance in this species. Furthermore, larger animals performed better, independent of colour and sex. Finally, we found no relative or absolute difference between males and females in their sprint performance. Taken together, our results suggest that there is no sex-specific or colour morph-specific differentiation in the use of microhabitats in this species.

We highlight the results of three recent forest {OMs}, which together explain a remarkable range of observed forest responses to altered resource availability. We conclude that {OMs} now offer a simple yet powerful approach to predicting the responses of forests-and, potentially; other plant types-to global change. We recommend ways in which {OMs} could be developed further in this direction.},

	abstract = {The increasing interest in the investigation of social behaviours of a group of animals has heightened the need for developing tools that provide robust quantitative data. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an attractive model for behavioural analysis; however, there are still limited ways to monitor fly behaviour in a quantitative manner. To study social behaviour of a group of flies, acquiring the position of each individual over time is crucial. There are several studies that have tried to solve this problem and make this data acquisition automated. However, none of these studies has addressed the problem of keeping track of flies for a long period of time in three-dimensional space. Recently, we have developed an approach that enables us to detect and keep track of multiple flies in a three-dimensional arena for a long period of time, using multiple synchronized and calibrated cameras. After detecting flies in each view, correspondence between views is established using a novel approach we call the ‘sequential Hungarian algorithm’. Subsequently, the three-dimensional positions of flies in space are reconstructed. We use the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter together for data association and tracking. We evaluated rigorously the system's performance for tracking and behaviour detection in multiple experiments, using from one to seven flies. Overall, this system presents a powerful new method for studying complex social interactions in a three-dimensional environment.},

	abstract = {A decade ahead of their time, von Schantz et al. united sexual selection and free radical biology by identifying causal links between deep-rooted physiological processes that dictate resistance to toxic waste from oxidative metabolism (reactive oxygen species, {ROS}), and phenotypic traits, such as ornaments. Ten years later, these ideas have still only been tested with indirect estimates of free radical levels (oxidative stress) subsequent to the action of innate and dietary antioxidants. Here, we measure net superoxide (a selection pressure for antioxidant production) and experimentally manipulate superoxide antioxidation using a synthetic mimetic of superoxide dismutase ({SOD}), Eukarion 134 ({EUK}). We then measure the toxic effect of superoxide in terms of {DNA} erosion and concomitant loss of male breeding coloration in the lizard, Ctenophorus pictus. Control males suffered more {DNA} damage than {EUK} males. Spectroradiometry showed that male coloration is lost in relation to superoxide and covaries with {DNA} erosion; in control males, these variables explained loss of color, whereas in {EUK} males, the fading of coloration was unaffected by superoxide and unrelated to {DNA} damage. Thus, {EUK}'s powerful antioxidation removes the erosion effect of superoxide on coloration and experimentally verifies the prediction that colors reflect innate capacity for antioxidation.},

	abstract = {Relative to other metazoans, the mammalian integument is thought to be limited in colour. In particular, while iridescence is widespread among birds and arthropods, it has only rarely been reported in mammals. Here, we examine the colour, morphology and optical mechanisms in hairs from four species of golden mole (Mammalia: Chrysochloridae) that are characterized by sheens ranging from purple to green. Microspectrophotometry reveals that this colour is weak and variable. Iridescent hairs are flattened and have highly reduced cuticular scales, providing a broad and smooth surface for light reflection. These scales form multiple layers of light and dark materials of consistent thickness, strikingly similar to those in the elytra of iridescent beetles. Optical modelling suggests that the multi-layers produce colour through thin-film interference, and that the sensitivity of this mechanism to slight changes in layer thickness and number explains colour variability. While coloured integumentary structures are typically thought to evolve as sexual ornaments, the blindness of golden moles suggests that the colour may be an epiphenomenon resulting from evolution via other selective factors, including the ability to move and keep clean in dirt and sand.},

	abstract = {1. Protective coloration in insects may be aposematic or cryptic, and some species change defensive strategy between instars. In Sweden, the adult striated shieldbugs Graphosoma lineatum (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) undergo a seasonal colour change from pale brown and black striation in the pre-hibernating adults, to red and black striation in the same post-hibernating individuals. To the human eye the pre-hibernating adults appear cryptic against the withered late summer vegetation, whereas the red and black post-hibernating adults appear aposematic. This suggests a possibility of a functional colour change. However, what is cryptic to the human eye is not necessarily cryptic to a potential predator. 2. Therefore we tested the effect of coloration in adult G. lineatum on their detectability for avian predators. Great tits (Parus major) were trained to eat sunflower seeds hidden inside the emptied exoskeletons of pale or red G. lineatum. Then the detection time for both colour forms was measured in a dry vegetation environment. 3. The birds required a longer time to find the pale form of G. lineatum than the red one. The pale form appears more cryptic on withered late summer vegetation than the red form, not only to the human eye but also to avian predators. The result supports the idea that the adult individuals of G. lineatum undergo a functional change from a cryptic protective coloration to an aposematic one.},

In this Study, the Subtle variation in wing colors of one species of milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus (Large Milkweed Bug) was measured to determine if the color variation was related to sex or body size. Fifty-eight bugs were hand-collected at three sites in northeast Georgia, and their wings scanned using a slide scanner and measured digitally using image analysis software. Wings of females were larger than those of males in general, and the color analyses showed statistically significant differences in wing line between mates and females. Females also had darker black wing sections than males, which could be evidence of a sex-related difference in immune function. Regardless of sex, wings of larger bugs had deeper orange color and darker black, which may increase the aposematic contrast. Finally, several differences in wing color were found between sites, suggesting either site-level variation in host-plant quality or relatedness among individuals within sites. This study is the first to quantify in detail the wing colors of milkweed bugs and forms the basis for future research into this little-studied aspect of this insect.},

Inconspicuous changes in grazing and vegetation structure caused host ants to be replaced by similar but unsuitable congeners, explaining the extinction of European Maculinea populations. Once this problem was identified, {UK} ecosystems were perturbed appropriately, validating models predicting the recovery and subsequent dynamics of the butterfly and ants at 78 sites. The successful identification and reversal of the problem provide a paradigm for other insect conservation projects.},

	abstract = {Although considerable progress has been made in reducing concentrations of persistent organic compounds in the environment, these contaminants are still found in many taxa. Here, we investigate the relationship between environmental contamination and avian egg coloration to examine whether egg coloration could be used as a bioindicator of contaminant load. The Herring Gull Monitoring Programme has documented changes in contaminant levels found in herring gull Larus argentatus Pontoppidan eggs across the Great Lakes for nearly 40 years. We measured the coloration of these eggs using reflectance spectrophotometry and evaluated the influence of a suite of contaminants on egg colour using general linear mixed models. Herring gull egg coloration was related to the levels of environmental contaminants found within the eggs. Our findings reveal a negative association between blue-green chroma and a principal component explaining contaminant load. We also found that ultraviolet chroma varied positively with contaminant load, whereas brown chroma was not significantly related to contaminant load. In addition, a cross-validated discriminant function analysis was able to correctly classify 84\% of eggs to either high or low contaminant load. This is an important first step in assessing the utility of using egg coloration as a proxy for contaminant load in a colonially breeding waterbird. Synthesis and applications. Our study utilized a large, multi-year data set to provide the first evidence that a suite of environmental contaminants appear to influence avian eggshell coloration. We also found that objective spectrophotometric measurements provide a reliable tool for assessment of egg contaminant load, and we provide a discriminant function for contaminant classification directly in the field. Our findings should be broadly relevant, because the pigments responsible for avian egg coloration are shared across all birds. The application of eggshell colour as a bio-monitoring tool has important conservation and management applications; measuring egg coloration may provide a rapid, inexpensive and nondestructive means of estimating contaminant levels in the environment. This may provide an essential tool for monitoring areas or species of concern, as well as evaluating potential human health risks, by identifying populations supported by an environment that requires more attention and potentially environmental remediation.},

Wolbachia was found in eight of the nine sampling sites, with between 31.8 and 100\% of ants infected. These infection rates are substantially higher than those previously observed for other invasive ants such as Linepithema humile and Solenopsis invicta. All sequences of Wolbachia were genetically identical. Arsenophonus was observed in five of the nine sampling sites, with infection rates ranging between 4.5 and 50.8\%. Like Wolbachia, Arsenophonus can modify the sex-ratio of its hosts via male-killing. Arsenophonus was found to co-occur with Wolbachia in the same ants in five of the nine sampling sites. Rhizobiales is a clade of symbiotic bacteria mostly found in herbivorous ants. These bacteria help provide nitrogen to their hosts and were found in only three of the nine sampling sites with an infection rate of 1.6-11.8\%. It also co-occurred with the other bacteria. There was no genetic variation in Arsenophonus and Rhizobiales samples, with the exception of a sequence from one Arsenophonus sample in Samoa that differed by a single base pair. These bacterial endosymbionts may contribute to the population variability in A. gracilipes and may be manipulated for the purpose of pest management.},

Here, we test for, and find, accelerated evolution of color patterns in bird taxa that breed at higher latitudes compared with those breeding in the tropics, analyzing data from seven diverse avian families. Most important, we show that the extent of overlap of species' breeding ranges (degree of sympatry) explains the elevated rate of color pattern evolution at higher latitudes. We suggest that the dynamic shifts in breeding ranges that accompanied climatic changes during the last 3 million years (Milankovitch Oscillations) resulted in more rapid and more frequent secondary contact at high latitudes. We argue that sympatry among diverging dades causes greater divergence of color traits in birds at higher latitudes through sexual, social, or ecological character displacement that accelerate rates of evolution, and through the selective elimination of weakly differentiated lineages that hybridize and fuse in sympatry (differential fusion).},

The ratio index correlated with body size, which weakened the strength of conclusions that could be drawn. The slope-adjusted ratio index requires an independent and large data set with which to generate the expected values, and was likewise sensitive to body size. The residual index, with appropriate transformations to achieve homoscedasticity, was the most reliable index because it did not vary with body size, and we recommend its general use in behavioral studies that require a condition estimate.},

Here we review how differences between fossil and modern data and the addition of recently available palaeontological information influence our understanding of the current extinction crisis.

They are mainly transmitted vertically, from mothers to offspring and induce various alterations of their hosts' sexuality and reproduction, the most commonly reported phenomenon being Cytoplasmic Incompatibility ({CI}), observed in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Basically, {CI} results in a more or less intense embryonic mortality, occurring in crosses between males infected by Wolbachia and uninfected females. In D. simulans, Wolbachia and {CI} were observed in 1986. Since then, this host species has become a model system for investigating the polymorphism of Wolbachia infections and {CI}. In this review we describe the different Wolbachia infections currently known to occur in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The two species are highly contrasting with regard to symbiotic diversity: while five Wolbachia variants have been described in D. simulans natural populations, D. melanogaster seems to harbor one Wolbachia variant only. Another marked difference between these two Drosophila species is their permissiveness with regard to {CI}, which seems to be fully expressed in D. simulans but partially or totally repressed in D. melanogaster, demonstrating the involvement of host factors in the control of {CI} levels. The potential of the two host species regarding the understanding of {CI} and its evolution is also discussed.},

	abstract = {The breast-plate plumage of male Lawes' parotia (Parotia lawesii) produces dramatic colour changes when this bird of paradise displays on its forest-floor lek. We show that this effect is achieved not solely by the iridescence—that is an angular-dependent spectral shift of the reflected light—which is inherent in structural coloration, but is based on a unique anatomical modification of the breast-feather barbule. The barbules have a segmental structure, and in common with many other iridescent feathers, they contain stacked melanin rodlets surrounded by a keratin film. The unique property of the parotia barbules is their boomerang-like cross section. This allows each barbule to work as three coloured mirrors: a yellow-orange reflector in the plane of the feather, and two symmetrically positioned bluish reflectors at respective angles of about 30°. Movement during the parotia's courtship displays thereby achieves much larger and more abrupt colour changes than is possible with ordinary iridescent plumage. To our knowledge, this is the first example of multiple thin film or multi-layer reflectors incorporated in a single structure (engineered or biological). It nicely illustrates how subtle modification of the basic feather structure can achieve novel visual effects. The fact that the parotia's breast feathers seem to be specifically adapted to give much stronger colour changes than normal structural coloration implies that colour change is important in their courtship display.},

Many animals have taken advantage of this property to build receptor systems capable of analyzing the polarization of incoming light, as polarized light is abundant in natural scenes (commonly being produced by scattering or reflection). Such polarization sensitivity has long been associated with behavioral tasks like orientation or navigation. However, only recently have we become aware that it can be incorporated into a high-level visual perception akin to color vision, permitting segmentation of a viewed scene into regions that differ in their polarization. By analogy to color vision, we call this capacity polarization vision. It is apparently used for tasks like those that color vision specializes in: contrast enhancement, camouflage breaking, object recognition, and signal detection and discrimination. While color is very useful in terrestrial or shallow-water environments, it is an unreliable cue deeper in water due to the spectral modification of light as it travels through water of various depths or of varying optical quality. Here, polarization vision has special utility and consequently has evolved in numerous marine species, as well as at least one terrestrial animal. In this review, we consider recent findings concerning polarization vision and its significance in biological signaling.},

In nocturnal species, in contrast, such visual communication has received little attention because the assumption is that they exclusively rely on vocal communication. Here, we use a field experiment to investigate whether eagle owls, Bubo bubo, communicate through visual signals at night. We artificially decreased the brightness of the white feathers surrounding fledgling eagle owls' mouths during the post-fledging dependence period, and investigated the effect of this treatment by comparing the condition of these birds to that of birds who received a control treatment. Several physiological parameters considered in our analyses indicate that control owlets were in better condition than owlets with brightness-reduced mouth feathers, which suggests that they received more or better food from feeding parents who discriminated between those young. Brightness-dependent reactions of parent owls suggest that visual signalling may be more widely employed than previously thought, and studying birds at night may reveal sophisticated strategies of animal communication.},

To better understand the evolutionary implications of experience-mediated plasticity in female choice, we investigated the effect of acoustic experience during rearing on female responsiveness to male song in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. Acoustic experience has unique biological relevance in this species: a morphological mutation has rendered over 90 per cent of males on the Hawaiian island of Kauai silent in fewer than 20 generations, impeding females' abilities to locate potential mates. Females reared in silent conditions mimicking Kauai were less discriminating of male calling song and more responsive to playbacks, compared with females that experienced song during rearing. Our results to our knowledge, are the first demonstration of long-term effects of acoustic experience in an arthropod, and suggest that female T. oceanicus may be able to compensate for the reduced availability of long-range male sexual signals by increasing their responsiveness to the few remaining signallers. Understanding the adaptive significance of experience-mediated plasticity in female choice provides insight into processes that facilitate rapid evolutionary change and shape sexual selection pressure in natural populations.},

Further, under the incidence of linearly polarized light, the reflected intensity was markedly reduced when observed through a linear polarizer set with its optical axis perpendicular to that of the incident light. These results indicate that P. auratus does not possess any circularly polarizing reflectors. {TEM} observations revealed a total of ten or twelve thin layers (about 60-120 nm in thickness) of two types of material (electron-dense and electron-lucent) alternately stacked in the epicuticle. The thickness of the layers in the different color forms of the beetle corresponded to the peak wavelengths in the reflectance spectra, lambda max(alpha), with thicker layers found in beetles exhibiting reflectance peaks at longer wavelengths and vice versa.

A total of 210 males were individually marked generating 340 captures, between 1997 and 2003. The model with the best fit indicated a quadratic relationship between brightness of carotenoid-derived coloration and survival, independent of time and age of the birds, so that individuals with intermediate plumage brightness survived longer. Hence, results stress that plumage color in male serins is under stabilizing natural selection, with reduced survival both in drabber and brighter individuals. While lower condition of drabber individuals can explain their lower survival, brighter birds can suffer more from predation risk or from a higher investment of resources into mate attraction and/or reproduction.},

	abstract = {Research on animal ornaments used in mate choice has largely focused on males, particularly for bird species with sexually dimorphic coloured patches of feathers and integument. Relatively less information is available for coloured ornaments of sexually monomorphic species and the use of these ornaments during mate choice. The king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, is a monogamous marine bird in which both sexes show very similar coloured ornaments ({UV} and yellow-orange colours on the beak, yellow orange auricular feathers, and yellow to rusty-brown breast feathers). These ornaments have previously been implicated in mate choice. We used manipulative experiments to test the role of coloured feather patches in the choice of partners that occurs during pair formation. Experimental reduction of auricular patch size delayed pairing, and alteration of auricular and breast patch colour from yellow to white caused an even stronger delay (white treatments gave adults the appearance of immature birds). Surprisingly, we found that time to pairing did not differ between treatments for females, but males showed significant delays in pairing in general and especially when treated. Thus, females seemed to be more selective in mate choice than males, a phenomenon that might be explained by a male-biased sex ratio in the colony. Nevertheless, our results indicate that choice of mate may be much stronger in one of the sexes in what appears to be a sexually monomorphic species, for which we expected sexual selection to favour mutually strong male and female mate choice.

To enhance its transmission, W. pipientis has evolved a large scale of host manipulations: parthenogenesis induction, feminization, and male killing. W. pipientis's most common effect is a crossing incompatibility between infected males and uninfected females. Little is known about the genetics and biochemistry of these symbionts because of their fastidious requirements. The affinity of W. pipientis for the microtubules associated with the early divisions in eggs may explain some of their effects. Such inherited microorganisms are thought to have been major factors in the evolution of sex determination, eusociality, and speciation. W. pipientis isolates are also of interest as vectors for the modification of wild insect populations, in the improvement of parasitoid wasps in biological pest control, and as a new method for interfering with diseases caused by filarial nematodes.},

	abstract = {The Spotted Bowerbird, Chlamydera maculata, appears to be sexually monomorphic. We caught and marked 118 birds in central Queensland, and sexed 88 using molecular methods. We found that our catch was strongly male-biased, both at bower sites and at non-bower feeding sites. We continued to observe the bird's behaviour after their release and so sub-divided males into sexual status groups as either bower-owners or nonowners. We searched for morphological measures, subjectively judged colour differences and quantitatively collected spectral measures of the visual properties of the crest feathers that would allow us to separate birds of differing sex and status. We found that bower owners had larger crests than non-owner males or females and that crest area provided the most accurate predictor of a bird's sex and status in a discriminant function analysis. We studied a cohort of seven males who went from non-owners to bower owners over three years, and found that their change in status was accompanied by a change in crest size - the only significant change in their morphology. Crest size did not relate to the mating success of a bower-owner. Instead, we suggest why the crest may differ between status groups and the implications that this may have for the sexual behaviour of male and female Spotted Bowerbirds.},

	abstract = {Conspicuous plumage patches have evolved in birds as conspecific signals for mate attraction and assessment, intersexual competition or to signal alarm. Signals may alternatively be directed at potential predators to discourage pursuit. Rails (Family Rallidae) are ground-dwelling birds, many of which inhabit wetlands, while others occur in forests and grasslands. They are renown for their secretive nature and the tendency to flick their tails when observed. This behavior is more conspicuous in species with white undertail coverts that contrast sharply with darker body plumage. Using species comparisons and controlling for phylogeny, we investigated four hypotheses for the evolution of white undertail coverts in rails. We found little support for the hypothesis that white tails are sexually selected: white tails were not more common in species with polygamous as opposed to monogamous mating systems, species with sexual dimorphism, nor species that display their tails in courtship. Nor did our results support the hypothesis that white tail plumage evolved for intersexual competition during territorial interactions. Instead, we found that species that flock for at least part of the year and species found in open as opposed to concealing habitats were significantly more likely to have white undertail coverts. Rail species inhabiting concealing habitats are less commonly gregarious and more likely selected for crypsis. Using phylogenetically-controlled statistical inference we found that adaptation to open wetland habitats significantly precedes the evolution of white undertails, whereas gregariousness likely evolved later in some lineages. The inferred order of trait evolution suggests that this plumage characteristic could have been selected primarily for enhancement of an anti-predator signal rather than a social signal for conspecifics.},

For small colour distances there was also significant linear correlations between accuracy and response time for the individual bees. The results show both between task and within task speed-accuracy tradeoffs in bees, which suggests the possibility of a sophisticated and dynamic decision-making process.},

White scales of the male Small White, Pieris rapae crucivora, show a strong gradient in both the density in pigment granules and the reflectance. After pigment extraction by aqueous ammonia, scales of male P. r. crucivora closely resemble the unpigmented scales of female P. r. crucivora. Only a minor gradient exists in the white and orange scales of the male Orange Tip, Anthocharis cardamines. Pigment extraction of orange scales of A. cardamines causes bleaching. Partial bleaching transforms the scales so that they resemble certain scales of Phoebis philea that have a natural extreme gradient. Reflectance measurements on an artificial stack of two overlapping scales as well as on the scale stacks existing on intact and partially denuded wings of the Large White, Pieris brassicae, quantitatively demonstrate the reflectance enhancement by scale stacking.

	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that cryptically colored eggs would suffer less predation than conspicuous eggs in the ground-nesting red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa. We used A. rufa as a model species because it has a wide range of natural egg colors, the eggs are widely available from breeding farms, and nests are easily mimicked because they are scrapes containing no vegetation. The study was conducted in the spring of 2001 in forest and fallow fields of central Spain in Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real. We used 384 clutches of natural eggs that were white, white spotted, brown, or brown spotted. Within clutches, eggs were consistent in color and size; among clutches, color differences were distributed across habitats. Clutches were checked once after 2 wk of exposure. Cryptic coloration had a survival advantage that was dependent on the local suite of predators. Rodent predation was nonselective with respect to clutch color; however, avian predation was significantly higher for conspicuous clutches. In addition, there was an interaction of landscape and egg color for avian predation. In forest landscapes, the clutches with highest survival were brown spotted, whereas in fallow landscapes, brown and brown spotted clutches had higher survival than white and white potted clutches. Thus, both the predator suite and the landscape had significant effects on the value of cryptic egg coloration. Our study is relevant for conservationists and managers in charge of restocking programs in hunting areas. The release of other partridge species or their hybrids could result in hybridization with wild partridges, potentially leading to nonoptimal clutch pigmentation and reduced survival of the native species. We therefore recommend that local authorities, managers, and conservationists be cautious with the use of alien species and hybrids and release only autochthonous species of partridges within their natural ranges.},

This includes disruptive coloration, where high-contrast markings placed at an animal's edge break up the true body shape. Successful disruption may also involve non-marginal markings found away from the body outline that create 'false edges' more salient than the true body form ('surface disruption'). However, previous work has focused on breaking up the true body outline, not on surface disruption. Furthermore, while high contrast may enhance disruption, it is untested where on the body different contrasts should be placed for maximum effect. We used artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field, to determine the effectiveness of surface disruption, and of different luminance contrast placed in different prey locations. Disruptive coloration was no more effective when comprising high luminance contrast per se, but its effectiveness was dramatically increased with high-contrast markings placed away from the body outline, creating effective surface disruption. A model of avian visual edge processing showed that surface disruption does not make object detection more difficult simply by creating false edges away from the true body outline, but its effect may also be based on a different visual mechanism. Our study has implications for whether animals can combine disruptive coloration with other 'conspicuous' signalling strategies.},

A very recent morphological mutation, flatwing, has caused the loss of male song in field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) from the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Previous studies in this and related species have shown that females require male courtship song to mount males, but flatwing T. oceanicus males still achieve matings. Females from Kauai may have a relaxed requirement for male courtship song, or flatwing males may compensate for their inability to sing by altering other courtship behaviors. We tested whether male courtship and female responses to male courtship were preadapted in a way that facilitated the spread of the male wing mutation or if parallel changes in male courtship and female responses accompanied the mutation. We performed mating trials in 2 captive-bred populations to assess how mating behavior varied depending on the presence or absence of courtship song playback. The first was an ancestral population from Kauai established prior to the emergence of the flatwing mutation, and the second was derived from Kauai after the mutation became prevalent. Mating behaviors did not differ qualitatively or quantitatively between the ancestral and current populations, and females from both accepted males for mating in the absence of courtship song. Our results provide direct evidence that a mechanism allowing flatwing males to mate with females was in place before the mutation actually arose on Kauai and demonstrate how preexisting behavior facilitated the rapid spread of a novel morphological mutation.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have shown much recent interest in the costliness and signal content of colorful plumage displays in birds. Although many studies suggest that both carotenoid- and structurally-based plumage colors are condition-dependent indicators of health and nutritional state at the time ornamental feathers are grown, there is little experimental evidence supporting the idea that melanin pigmentation is a reliable signal of condition during molt. Instead, melanin-based ornamental coloration often reveals the competitive ability and dominance of individuals throughout the year. However, this work does not indicate which proximate environmental factors shape the expression of melanin pigmentation at the time of feather growth. Because of the link between melanin coloration and the social environment, it is possible that the development of brightly colored plumage may be associated with aggressive social interactions during feather molt. Here, we show that melanin-based ornamental coloration in male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) is correlated with the degree to which individuals interact aggressively with conspecifics during molt. Males that were dominant (beta, but not alpha) within captive social groups during molt grew larger badges than subordinates. Groups of males that had higher rates of aggression during molt grew larger badges than less aggressive triads. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that melanin pigmentation and plumage-based status badges are related to the competitive history of individuals during feather development. By coupling badge size directly with aggressive experiences during molt, birds can use their status signal to honestly indicate their likelihood of winning agonistic encounters throughout the year.},

However, the isolation status and the relationship between parental divergence and post-mating isolation among closely related sympatric specialists are still poorly understood. Here, multi-locus sequence were used to estimate the relationship among three host plant-specific closely related flea beetles, Altica cirsicola, A. fragariae and A. viridicyanea (abbreviated as {AC}, {AF} and {AV} respectively). The tree topologies were inconsistent using different gene or different combinations of gene fragments. The relationship of {AF}+({AC}+{AV}) was supported, however, by both gene tree and species tree based on concatenated data. Post-mating reproductive data on the results of crossing these three species are best interpreted in the light of a well established phylogeny. Nuclear-induced but not Wolbachia-induced unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, which was detected in {AC}-{AF} and {AF}-{AV} but not in {AC}-{AV}, may also suggest more close genetic affinity between {AC} and {AV}. Prevalence of Wolbachia in these three beetles, and the endosymbiont in most individuals of {AV} and {AC} sharing a same wsp haplotype may give another evidence of {AF}+({AC}+{AV}). Our study also suggested that these three flea beetles diverged in a relative short time (0.94 My), which may be the result of shifting between unrelated host plants and distinct host specificity. Incomplete post-mating isolation while almost complete lineage sorting indicated that effective pre-mating isolation among these three species should have evolved.},

We employed a variety of colour indices, based on spectral shape and avian visual models but, despite significant variation in condition and coloration, found no evidence for condition-dependence of {UV}/blue or white plumage colour during either season.

	abstract = {The colour discrimination of individual free-flying honeybees (Apis mellifera) was tested with simultaneous and successive viewing conditions for a variety of broadband reflectance stimuli. For simultaneous viewing bees used form vision to discriminate patterned target stimuli from homogeneous coloured distractor stimuli, and for successive discrimination bees were required to discriminate between homogeneously coloured stimuli. Bees were significantly better at a simultaneous discrimination task, and we suggest this is explained by the inefficiency with which the bees' brain can code and retrieve colour information from memory when viewing stimuli successively. Using simultaneous viewing conditions bees discriminated between the test stimuli at a level equivalent to 1 just-noticeable-difference for human colour vision. Discrimination of colours by bees with simultaneous viewing conditions exceeded previous estimates of what is possible considering models of photoreceptor noise measured in bees, which suggests spatial and/or temporal summation of colour signals for fine discrimination tasks. The results show that when behavioural experiments are used to collect data about the mechanisms facilitating colour discrimination in animals, it is important to consider the effects of the stimulus viewing conditions on results.},

Melanins are the most common pigments in animals. Correlations between genotypic and phenotypic qualities of the sender and size and morph of melanin-based traits are known, but it is contentious whether melanin-based colouration may signal any quality. We examined the effect of supplementing blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) with flavonoids, potent plant antioxidants, on plumage colouration. We demonstrate that melanin-based colour can fulfil all requirements of signals of phenotypic condition. As predicted by sexual selection theory, flavonoid supplementation influenced only the sexually dichromatic black cap of males, whereas the female homologous trait and the sexually monochromatic back colouration remained unaffected. Using avian vision models we show that birds can estimate male flavonoid intake from colouration of males' black cap. Because flavonoid ingestion can increase immune responsiveness in blackcaps, melanin head colouration may signal environmentally determined immune condition.},

	abstract = {In butterflies, wing colour may simultaneously be under sexual selection in the context of mating selection and natural selection in the context of thermoregulation. In the present study, we collected mated females of the green-veined white butterfly (Pieris napi) from locations spanning 960?km of latitude across Fennoscandia, and investigated sex-specific latitudinal wing colour variation in their offspring raised under identical conditions. We measured wing colour characteristics, including reflectance at wavelengths 300-700?nm and the degree of wing melanization. At all latitudes, females reflected more light in the short wavelengths ({\textless}?400?nm) and less in the long wavelengths ({\textgreater}?450?nm), and they were more melanized than males. However, female wing colour varied more with latitude than that of males. Among females, long wavelength reflectance decreased, whereas short wavelength reflectance and melanization increased, towards the north. By contrast, among males, latitudinal variation was found only in the ventral hindwing melanization. These results are consistent with the idea that the balance between natural and sexual selection acting on wing colour changes with latitude differently in males than females. The dark wing colour of females in the north may be a thermoregulatory adaptation, although males may be constrained from evolving the dark dorsal wing colour favoured by natural selection because of constant sexual selection across latitudes.

The study of these phenomena has informed an eclectic group of fields ranging, for example, from evolutionary processes in behavioural biology to micro-optical devices in technologically engineered systems. However, biological photonic systems are invariably structurally and often compositionally more elaborate than most synthetically fabricated photonic systems. For this reason, an appropriate gamut of physical methods and investigative techniques must be applied correctly so that the systems' photonic behaviour may be appropriately understood. Here, we survey a broad range of the most commonly implemented, successfully used and recently innovated physical methods. We discuss the costs and benefits of various spectrometric methods and instruments, namely scatterometers, microspectrophotometers, fibre-optic-connected photodiode array spectrometers and integrating spheres. We then discuss the role of the materials' refractive index and several of the more commonly used theoretical approaches. Finally, we describe the recent developments in the research field of photonic crystals and the implications for the further study of structural coloration in animals.},

Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1--representing high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet-blue chroma--and hue). Two different colour parameters (violet-blue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.},

Shifts between sensitivity classes are rare; three or four are believed to have happened in the course of avian evolution, one forming {UVS} higher passerines. Such shifts probably affect the expression of shortwave-dominated plumage signals. We have used genomic {DNA} sequencing to determine {VS} or {UVS} affinity in fairy-wrens and allies, Maluridae, a large passerine family basal to the known {UVS} taxa. We have also spectrophotometrically analysed male plumage coloration as perceived by the {VS} and {UVS} vision systems. Contrary to any other investigated avian genus, Malurus (fairy-wrens) contains species with amino acid residues typical of either {VS} or {UVS} cone opsins. Three bowerbird species (Ptilonorhynchidae) sequenced for outgroup comparison carry {VS} opsin genes. Phylogenetic reconstructions render one {UVS} gain followed by one or more losses as the most plausible evolutionary scenario. The evolution of avian ultraviolet sensitivity is hence more complex, as a single shift no longer explains its distribution in Passeriformes. Character correlation analysis proposes that {UVS} vision is associated with shortwave-reflecting plumage, which is widespread in Maluridae.},

	abstract = {Aposematic animals are often conspicuous. It has been hypothesized that one function of conspicuousness in such prey is to be detected from afar by potential predators: the 'detection distance hypothesis'. The hypothesis states that predators are less prone to attack at long detection range because more time is allowed for making the 'correct' decision not to attack the unprofitable prey. The detection distance hypothesis has gained some experimental support in that time-limited predators make more mistakes. To investigate effects of prey presentation distance we performed two experiments. First, in experiment 1, we investigated at what distance chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, could see the difference in colour between aposematic and plain mealworms. Birds chose the correct track in a two-way choice when prey were at 20, 40 and 60 cm distance but not at 80 cm. Second, in experiment 2, fifth-instar larvae of the aposematic bug Lygaeus equestris were presented to experienced chicks at 2, 20 or 60 cm distance. We found no difference in attack probability between distances. However, prey mortality was significantly lower for the shortest presentation distance. In conclusion, we found no support for the hypothesis that aposematic prey benefit from long-range detection; in fact they benefit from short-distance detection. This result, and others, suggests that the conspicuousness of aposematic prey at a distance may simply be a by-product of an efficient signalling function after detection.

	abstract = {Male Satin Bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) build stick structures known as bowers that serve as the focus for courtships and matings. Males decorate their bowers with numerous coloured decorations and are known to steal these decorations from one another. We investigated the stealing of bower decorations among males at the Bunya Mountains in Queensland, Australia. We aimed to (1) determine which classes of decorations were targets for theft in the studied population, and (2) examine whether the frequency at which individual decorations were stolen related to their intrinsic properties. To address our first aim, all decorations on the bowers of 21 adult males were labelled and their movements tracked throughout one mating season. To address our second aim, decorations stolen at least three times during the season were collected and their morphological and reflectance properties compared to those of decorations that were not stolen. In terms of the classes of decorations, tail feathers of Crimson Rosella (Platycercus elegans) were stolen more than any other class of decoration, but blue plastic bottletops were the most popular decorations relative to their availability on bowers. Frequently stolen individual decorations were similar to non-stolen items in their weights and surface areas, but were darker blue in colour than the decorations never stolen. Both bottletops and feathers reflected higher levels of ultraviolet ({UV}) light than did all other classes of bower decorations tested, thus suggesting that males may be using {UV} reflectance in sexual signalling. The darker blue, stolen decorations may increase contrast between the decoration collection and the platform, while the {UV}-reflecting subset of most frequently stolen decorations (bottletops and feathers) may increase contrast within the decoration collection. This in turn may increase the attractiveness of the display to females.},

Even though clutch predation in the tropics is high, tinamous are the only tropical ground-nesting birds that do not build a nest and do not lay cryptic eggs. I studied predation of great tinamou clutches in a lowland tropical forest and found that risk of predation was higher during incubation when the eggs are covered by the parent, than during laying when they are exposed, suggesting that predators primarily use cues from the incubating males to locate the clutch and not cues from the eggs. Clutch size had no effect on predation rate, even though larger clutches are more conspicuous to a human observer. Predation by visual cues is likely reduced during incubation by the camouflaged plumage and high nest attendance of males. If most predators use cues from the incubating male and not the eggs to locate clutches, then conspicuous egg color may have evolved in great tinamous as an intra-specific signal. I evaluate hypotheses that may explain the maintenance of conspicuous egg color in tinamous.},

We investigate the stability of such infection polymorphisms in a mathematical model with two populations linked by migration. We determine critical migration rates below which infected and uninfected populations can coexist. Analytical solutions of the critical migration rate are presented for mainland-island models. These serve as lower estimations for a more general model with two-way migration. The critical migration rate is positive if either Wolbachia causes a fecundity reduction in infected female hosts or its transmission is incomplete, and is highest for intermediate levels of {CI}.

	abstract = {The level of expression of secondary sexual characters has been suggested to signal male ability to resist parasitic infestations. To test this idea, several studies have examined the link between sexual signals and immunocompetence in birds. However, most of them have used only a single aspect of immune response to evaluate immunocompetence. We investigated the relation between bill colour and immunocompetence in captive male European blackbirds, Turdus merula, during the breeding season by assessing both cell-mediated and humoral components of the immune system. The blackbird is a sexually dimorphic species with bill colour varying from yellow to orange in males. Humoral immunity was assessed by measuring both primary and secondary responses to sheep red blood cell inoculation. Cell-mediated immunity was estimated with a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity response to an injection of a mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin). No relation was found between male bill colour and the primary humoral response. However, males with orange bills showed a lower secondary humoral response but a higher cell-mediated immune response than males with yellow bills. Thus, the relation between immunocompetence and a secondary sexual trait may differ markedly depending on which component of the immune system is under consideration. We discuss our results in relation to mechanisms involved in sexual selection. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In order to investigate the origin of the retroreflection, non-standard finite-difference time-domain method is applied and alternate shelf structure is found to be responsible for it. Its optical characteristics are more intuitively understood by two simple models, destructive interference between two units of one-sided shelf structure and two inversely inclined multilayers, although such models are not complete in a strict sense.

	abstract = {The idea that an aposematic prey combines crypsis at a distance with conspicuousness close up was tested in an experiment using human subjects. We estimated detectability of the aposematic larva of the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio, machaon, in two habitats, by presenting, on a touch screen, photographs taken at four different distances and measuring the time elapsed to discovery. The detectability of larvae in these images was compared with images that were manipulated, using existing colours either to increase or decrease conspicuousness. Detection time increased with distance for all colourations. However, at the closest distance, detection time was longer for the larvae manipulated to be more cryptic than for the natural and more conspicuous forms. This indicates that the natural colouration is not maximally cryptic at a short distance. Further, smaller increments in distance were needed to increase detection time for the natural than for the conspicuous larva. This indicates that the natural colouration is not maximally conspicuous at longer distances. Taken together, we present the first empirical support for the idea that some colour patterns may combine warning colouration at a close range with crypsis at a longer range. The implications of this result for the evolution of aposematism are discussed.},

	abstract = {Vision is one of the most important modalities for the remote perception of biologically important stimuli. Insects like honeybees and bumblebees use their colour and spatial vision to solve tasks, such as navigation, or to recognise rewarding flowers during foraging. Bee vision is one of the most intensively studied animal visual systems, and several models have been developed to describe its function. These models have largely assumed that bee vision is determined by mechanistic hard-wired circuits, with little or no consideration for behavioural plasticity or cognitive factors. However, recent work on both bee colour vision and spatial vision suggests that cognitive factors are indeed a very significant factor in determining what a bee sees. Individual bumblebees trade-off speed for accuracy, and will decide on which criteria to prioritise depending upon contextual information. With continued visual experience, honeybees can learn to use non-elemental processing, including configural mechanisms and rule learning, and can access top-down information to enhance learning of sophisticated, novel visual tasks. Honeybees can learn delayed-matching-to-sample tasks and the rules governing this decision making, and even transfer learned rules between different sensory modalities. Finally, bees can learn complex categorisation tasks and display numerical processing abilities for numbers up to and including four. Taken together, this evidence suggests that bees do have a capacity for sophisticated visual behaviours that fit a definition for cognition, and thus simple elemental models of bee vision need to take account of how a variety of factors may influence the type of results one may gain from animal behaviour experiments.},

	abstract = {When the potential contributions that offspring can make to parental fitness vary, parents benefit by diverting resources towards the offspring offering the highest return on investment. In birds, nestling begging has been hypothesized to allow parental assessment of the relative contribution that each offspring can make to parental fitness. Although begging is often interpreted as a signal of need, studies of nestling morphology, specifically carotenoid-based mouth colours, suggest that these traits signal not the need, but the quality of the nestlings. Here, I manipulated flange colour in a free-living population of house sparrows with experimental paints that did not feature a {UV} reflectance peak, but otherwise approximated carotenoid-based colours within the range of natural variation. I presented parents with one nestling that appeared to have the carotenoid-rich rictal flanges associated with high condition and one that appeared to have the carotenoid-poor flange colour associated with poor condition. Parents delivered more food items to the nestling that appeared to have carotenoid-rich flanges, a pattern driven by a strong female bias and a similar, but nonsignificant, trend in males. This study shows that parents attend to these visual signals rather than correlated features of nestling physiology associated with carotenoids. Broadly, this result suggests that at least some components of begging are used by parents to bias resource allocation towards their most promising, rather than most needy, offspring.

Since then, the effect of Wolbachia on their host's reproduction has drawn attention and has been increasingly investigated. Given the extreme complexity of this interaction, new study cases are welcomed to enhance its understanding. The present work addressed the influence of Wolbachia on Cx. quinquefasciatus, the cosmopolitan member of the Cx. pipiens complex. Samples of a Cx. quinquefasciatus colony ({wPip}(+)) originated from individuals naturally infected by Wolbachia pipientis B strain, were cured with tetracycline, yielding a Wolbachia-free colony ({wPip}(-)). Both the presence of bacteria and the efficiency of bacterial elimination were checked by {PCR} of the wsp gene. Total reproductive unidirectional incompatibility occurred when {wPip}(-) females were crossed with {wPip}(+) males, whereas the other three types of reciprocal crosses were viable. Reproductive aspects were also comparatively evaluated between colonies. Concerning oviposition time during the first gonotrophic cycle, {wPip}(+) females developed and laid eggs earlier than did {wPip}(-) females. Reproductive fitness was higher among {wPip}(-) than {wPip}(+) females regarding the following parameters: fertility: egg rafts/fed females: fecundity: eggs/raft, and viability: larvae/eggs. Conversely, longevity of {wPip}(-) females was lower. Summarising, although the infected mosquitoes have the advantage of a higher longevity, they have lower reproductive fitness. Our results are partly distinct from all other reports on Aedes and Culex mosquitoes previously published. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Pollinator visual systems differ considerably among broad groupings such as bees, bats, and birds, and it has been proposed that factors shaping the diversity of flower color in tropical plants include differences in pollinator perceptual abilities. Within the pollinators of the Neotropics, one major difference between taxa is that hummingbirds perceive color well across a broad range of wavelengths from 300-660 nm whereas most bees perceive color well over a narrower range spanning 300-550 nm. Thus, hummingbirds can see red and other long-wavelength reflection much better than bees. Another factor that could potentially influence flower color in tropical forests is the difference in light availability among habitats such as gaps, canopy, and forest understory. I conducted a survey of floral color in four Neotropical forests using a portable spectroradiometer to provide an unbiased measure of color reflectance. The primary pollinator agents and light habitats of each plant species were classified using primary literature or accounts of direct observations by experts. Flower color was not influenced by differences in light availability between open and closed habitats but was influenced by pollinator visual systems. Specifically, insect flowers reflected across a broad range of the spectrum but hummingbird flowers reflected mostly long-wavelength light (typically median wavelength {\textgreater}585 nm). Thus, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are not tuned specifically to hummingbird color sensitivity but instead may decrease conspicuousness to bees and other insects that have poor visual sensitivity to long-wavelength color.},

We identified two kinds of thresholds that must be overcome with human ameliorative measures before the ecosystem was able to recover. The first threshold was imposed primarily by extreme physical conditions such as exceedingly high surface temperature and impoverished soil, while the second was characterized by a critical level of biodiversity and a landscape context that accommodates dispersal and colonization processes. Our three treatment catchments (un-restored barren land, single-species plantation, and mixed-forest stand) exhibited dramatically different changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning over 4 decades. The mixed forest, having the highest level of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, possesses several major properties of tropical rain forest. These findings may have important implications for the restoration of many severely degraded or lost tropical forest ecosystems.},

Here, we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the superfamilies Papilionoidea, Hesperioidea and Hedyloidea to date based on morphological and molecular data. We reconstructed their phylogenetic relationships using parsimony and Bayesian approaches. We estimated times and rates of diversification along lineages in order to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Our results suggest that the butterflies, as traditionally understood, are paraphyletic, with Papilionidae being the sister-group to Hesperioidea, Hedyloidea and all other butterflies. Hence, the families in the current three superfamilies should be placed in a single superfamily Papilionoidea. In addition, we find that Hedylidae is sister to Hesperiidae, and this novel relationship is supported by two morphological characters. The families diverged in the Early Cretaceous but diversified after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene event. The diversification of butterflies is characterized by a slow speciation rate in the lineage leading to Baronia brevicornis, a period of stasis by the skippers after divergence and a burst of diversification in the lineages leading to Nymphalidae, Riodinidae and Lycaenidae.},

	abstract = {In contradiction to sexual selection theory, several studies showed that although the expression of melanin-based ornaments is usually under strong genetic control and weakly sensitive to the environment and body condition, they can signal individual quality. Covariation between a melanin-based ornament and phenotypic quality may result from pleiotropic effects of genes involved in the production of melanin pigments. Two categories of genes responsible for variation in melanin production may be relevant, namely those that trigger melanin production (yes or no response) and those that determine the amount of pigments produced. To investigate which of these two hypotheses is the most likely, I reanalysed data collected from barn owls (Tyto alba). The underparts of this bird vary from immaculate to heavily marked with black spots of varying size. Published cross-fostering experiments have shown that the proportion of the plumage surface covered with black spots, a eumelanin composite trait so-called "plumage spottiness", in females positively covaries with offspring humoral immunocompetence, and negatively with offspring parasite resistance (i.e. the ability to reduce fecundity of ectoparasites) and fluctuating asymmetry of wing feathers. However, it is unclear which component of plumage spottiness causes these relationships, namely genes responsible for variation in number of spots or in spot diameter. Number of spots reflects variation in the expression of genes triggering the switch from no eumelanin production to production, whereas spot diameter reflects variation in the expression of genes determining the amount of eumelanin produced per spot. In the present study, multiple regression analyses, performed on the same data sets, showed that humoral immunocompetence, parasite resistance and wing fluctuating asymmetry of cross-fostered offspring covary with spot diameter measured in their genetic mother, but not with number of spots. This suggests that genes responsible for variation in the quantity of eumelanin produced per spot are responsible for covariation between a melanin ornament and individual attributes. In contrast, genes responsible for variation in number of black spots may not play a significant role. Covariation between a eumelanin female trait and offspring quality may therefore be due to an indirect effect of melanin production.},

	abstract = {Although many avian eggs appear to be cryptically colored, many species also lay vibrant blue green eggs. This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration.},

	abstract = {I examined 963 study skins of Lesser Goldfinches (Carduelis psaltria) from the United States to central Mexico, for color, measurements, molt, and plumage wear. These specimens had been previously assigned to as many as three subspecies. Females did not vary geographically in color. Green-backed, green-eared males predominated in the Pacific coastal United States and northern Mexico. Black-backed, black-eared males predominated in the interior, east of 106 degrees West longitude. This west to east color difference varied clinally, and may be a simple genetic polymorphism, so subspecific distinctions cannot be justified by coloration alone. Measurements of bill, tail, and wing, but not tarsus, varied slightly but significantly from smallest along the Pacific coast to largest in south-central Mexico. Since measurements varied clinally, and overlapped extensively, subspecific separation based on size is not practical. Pacific coastal birds subjected to winter rainfall maxima had a complete postbreeding molt, with a sparse prebreeding body molt only in females, and a postjuvenal molt that replaced significantly more flight feathers in males. Interior birds subjected to summer precipitation maxima had a nearly complete or complete prebreeding molt and a usually less complete postbreeding molt. The postjuvenal and postbreeding molts of interior birds were very similar and did not differ between the sexes. Although these sexual and geographic variations of molt are striking, they may reflect phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental contingencies, rather than genetic differences. These variations in one intergrading population support doubts that the Humphrey-Parkes terminology for molts and plumages can reflect phylogenetic homologies among species.},

	abstract = {Temporal variation in selection is typically evaluated by estimating and comparing selection coefficients in natural populations. Meta-analyses of these coefficients have yielded important insights, but selection coefficients are limited in several respects, including low statistical power, imperfect fitness surrogates, and uncertainty regarding consequences for trait change. A complementary approach without these limitations is to examine temporal variation in adaptive traits themselves, which is mechanistically easier and more directly relevant to evolutionary consequences. We illustrate this approach by analyzing the colour patterns of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from each of six sites in Trinidad in each of 6 years. This system is particularly appropriate for our study because key aspects of colour variation are genetically-based and responsive to selection. However, although spatial patterns of colour variation have been extensively considered in this system, no study has yet formally assessed annual temporal variation in non-manipulated populations. Matching previous conclusions for the guppy system, we find that guppies from different sites manifest different colour patterns in association with different predation regimes. We here add the new finding that, although some temporal variation is present, spatial patterns of colour variation are generally consistent across years. These results suggest that, when considering adaptive traits, spatial variation is more important than temporal variation, although our study system might be exceptional in this regard. Additional studies examining spatiotemporal variation in adaptive traits could help to improve our understanding of the role that spatiotemporal variation in selection plays in the evolutionary process. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 108–122.},

In particular, while iridescence is widespread among birds and arthropods, it has only rarely been reported in mammals. Here, we examine the colour, morphology and optical mechanisms in hairs from four species of golden mole (Mammalia: Chrysochloridae) that are characterized by sheens ranging from purple to green. Microspectrophotometry reveals that this colour is weak and variable. Iridescent hairs are flattened and have highly reduced cuticular scales, providing a broad and smooth surface for light reflection. These scales form multiple layers of light and dark materials of consistent thickness, strikingly similar to those in the elytra of iridescent beetles. Optical modelling suggests that the multi-layers produce colour through thin-film interference, and that the sensitivity of this mechanism to slight changes in layer thickness and number explains colour variability. While coloured integumentary structures are typically thought to evolve as sexual ornaments, the blindness of golden moles suggests that the colour may be an epiphenomenon resulting from evolution via other selective factors, including the ability to move and keep clean in dirt and sand.},

The humoral immune challenge enhanced the response to {LPS} similarly in differently coloured nestlings. In contrast, the same humoral immune challenge enhanced immune response to {PHA} in dark reddish melanic nestlings while reducing it in pale reddish melanic nestlings.

The additional signals are thought to increase the effects of the visual signals on predators. Olfactory signals are much emphasized, but later studies have shown that also auditory signals like the buzzing of certain insects might have multimodal effects. The wasp displays typical visual aposematic signals, black and yellow stripes, but does also emit a characteristic buzzing. We wanted to test if, and in what way, the visual and acoustic display of the wasp has an aversive function on the predators. We therefore conducted a 12-trial discrimination-learning task on inexperienced chicks to study whether there are innate biases toward these signals and how they affect the speed of avoidance learning. We also performed three extinction-learning trials to study how memorable the signals were to the chicks. We show that the visual signals in the display of the wasp contribute to the protection from predators but in different ways; the yellow color had an aversive effect on inexperienced predators, while the striped pattern improved the aversion learning. The sound did not enhance the innate aversions but increased the aversion learning of stripes in green prey.},

	abstract = {The strongest known circular polarization of biotic origin is the left-circularly polarized ({LCP}) light reflected from the metallic shiny exocuticle of certain beetles of the family Scarabaeidae. This phenomenon has been discovered by Michelson in 1911. Although since 1955 it has been known that the human eye perceives a visual illusion when stimulated by circularly polarized ({CP}) light, it was discovered only recently that a stomatopod shrimp is able to perceive circular polarization. It is pertinent to suppose that scarab beetles reflecting {LCP} light in an optical environment (vegetation) being deficient in {CP} signals may also perceive circular polarization and use it to find each other (mate/conspecifics) as until now it has been believed. We tested this hypothesis in six choice experiments with several hundred individuals of four scarab species: Anomala dubia, Anomala vitis (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Rutelinae), and Cetonia aurata, Potosia cuprea (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Cetoniinae), all possessing left-circularly polarizing exocuticle. From the results of our experiments we conclude that the studied four scarab species are not attracted to {CP} light when feeding or looking for mate or conspecifics. We demonstrated that the light reflected by host plants of the investigated scarabs is circularly unpolarized. Our results finally solve a puzzle raised over one hundred years ago, when Michaelson discovered that scarab beetles reflect circularly polarized light. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Coherent scattering causing iridescence is frequently encountered in the dorsal wings or wing tips of male pierids. We investigated the effect of the pterins on wing reflectance by local extraction of the pigments with aqueous ammonia and simultaneous spectrophotometric measurements. The ultraviolet-absorbing leucopterin was extracted prominently from the white Pieris species, and the violet-absorbing xanthopterin and blue-absorbing erythropterin were mainly derived from the yellow- and orangecolored Coliadinae, but they were also extracted from the dorsal wing tips of many male Pierinae. Absorption spectra deduced from wing reflectance spectra distinctly diverge from the absorption spectra of the extracted pigments, which indicate that when embedded in wing scales the pterins differ from those in solution. The evolution of pierid wing coloration is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For movement-based signals where movement is restricted to a single plane, measurements from a single viewpoint can be used to consider a range of viewing positions basal on simple geometric calculations. However, considerations of signal properties from a range of viewing positions for movements extending into three-dimensions (3D) are more problematic. We present here a new framework that overcomes this limitation, and enables us to quantify the extent to which movement-based signals are view-specific. To illustrate its application, a Jacky lizard tail flick signal was filmed with synchronized cameras and the position of the tail tip digitized for both recordings. Camera alignment enabled the construction of a 3D display action pattern profile. We analyzed the profile directly and used it to create a detailed 3D animation. In the virtual environment, we were able to film the same signal from multiple viewing positions and using a computational motion analysis algorithm (gradient detector model) to measure local image velocity in order to predict view dependent differences in signal properties. This approach will enable consideration of a range of questions concerning movement-based signal design and evolution that were previously out of reach [Current Zoology 56 (3): 327-336,2010].},

We perform one of the most extensive series of wing pattern manipulations in butterflies, dissecting every component of the 'bulls-eye' eyespot patterns in both ventral and dorsal wing surfaces of males to test the trait's appeal to females. We conclude that females select males on the basis of the size and brightness of the dorsal eyespot's ultraviolet reflecting pupils. Pupil absence is strongly selected against, as are artificially enlarged pupils. Small to intermediate (normal sized) pupils seem to function equally well. This work contradicts earlier experiments that suggest that the size of dorsal eyespots plays a role in female choice and explains why male dorsal eyespots are very variable in size and often have indistinct rings of coloration, as the only feature under selection by females seems to be the central white pupil. We propose that sexual selection by female choice, rather than predator avoidance, may have been an important selective factor in the early stages of eyespot evolution in ancestral Lepidopteran lineages.},

	abstract = {Blue-green colours in avian eggs have been proposed as post-mating signals of female phenotypic quality to their mates. Egg colour may not only indicate female value, but also the quality of the eggs themselves and of resulting offspring. To date, there has been no demonstration of an association between egg colour and egg or offspring immune quality. We here show that the intensity of blue-green colour of pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca eggs reflects the amount of maternal antibodies in the yolk, a form of passive immunity crucial for offspring performance. Moreover, egg colour predicts fledging success. Also, incubating females in better condition lay more colourful eggs. The immunoglobulin level in incubating females is positively associated with that in the eggs. These results support the signalling hypothesis of eggshell coloration, underlining its role as an indicator of trans-generational transmission of immune defences in birds.},

	abstract = {The bright colours of parrots are caused by psittacofulvin pigments, which appear unique to this Order, and by structural colours. We measured red (psittacofulvin), green (mixed) and blue (structural) colours of wild burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus of northeastern Patagonia, Argentina, and measured nestlings regularly to obtain data on breeding success and nestling growth. As adult feathers are moulted outside the breeding season, adult body condition could not be measured directly during feather growth, and climatic conditions were used as an indirect parameter. The colony of burrowing parrots is surrounded by Monte steppe habitat, the breeding success has been shown to depend strongly on the climatic patterns. The area experienced a drought with very poor breeding success as well as a year of above-average precipitation during the study period, serving as a natural experiment. We thus analysed the variability of colouration within the population among and within breeding seasons. We observed strong inter-annual differences in nestling and adult colouration. Nestlings grew blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness during better conditions, and when controlling for year effects, nestlings with higher mass and from more successful families also had blue feathers with lower achromatic brightness. Adult blue feathers showed the same trend, with lower achromatic brightness in the moult following breeding seasons of better conditions. In contrast, during better conditions, adults grew red feathers with higher achromatic brightness and the colour hue was also affected, and the hue of the red region of nestlings varied with the hatching order. The colour of all three regions of nestlings varied between nests, and the colour of the red region of adult males positively correlated with breeding success (clutch size, brood size). In summary, the present data suggest that environmental conditions contribute to variability in both structural and the psittacofulvin-based colours of wild burrowing parrots.},

A range of interesting three-dimensional photonic crystal structures operating at visible wavelengths was discovered, including both disordered and ordered non-close-packed lattices of cuticular spheres and bicontinuous diamond-based architectures. The discovered photonic structures display a large variation in lattice constants and dielectric filling fractions and thereby create optical reflectance colors spanning the entire visible range. To transform these bio-polymeric photonic crystals into heat and photo-stable inorganic structures, a low-temperature bio-templating method was developed. Using organic-inorganic hybrid silica sol-gel infiltration-templation chemistry combined with acid-etching template removal, stable inverse photonic structures were fabricated. The inverse structures display good structural quality and vivid reflection properties.},

	abstract = {A recent hypothesis suggests that birds' blue-green egg colors may be a sexually selected signal of female (and potentially nestling) quality that males use to make parental investment decisions. While there is some empirical support for this idea, both theory and observations question its validity. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the influence of egg color on male American robin Turdus migratorius behavior by replacing natural clutches with four artificial eggs that were all either pale or vividly colored, close to the extremes in natural egg coloration. At the end of the incubation period, three unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest, and parental provisioning behavior was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6, and 9 days old. Male provisioning rate for 3-day-old nestlings was significantly higher in the vivid egg treatment compared to both the pale egg treatment and untreated controls, but there was no effect of egg color on paternal behavior at the older nestling stages. Male feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was only weakly positively related to natural egg color (chroma) when nestlings were 3 days old. These results suggest that blue-green egg color may act as a post-mating signal of female quality or investment in this species, but our findings do not exclude the possibility that egg color pigmentation also serves other adaptive functions.},

Historically, the butterfly was largely restricted to a single plant species, Helianthemum nummularium, but recent warmer conditions have enabled the butterfly to increasingly use the more widespread plant species Geranium molle. This has resulted in a substantial increase in available habitat and rapid range expansion by the butterfly (79 kilometers northward in Britain in 20 years). Interactions among species are often seen as constraints on species’ responses to climate change, but we show that temperature-dependent changes to interspecific interactions can also facilitate change.},

Recent work suggests that colorful tails, deflective displays, and striped patterns may represent antipredator mechanisms used by immature lizards to compensate for being more active and hence more vulnerable to predation (increased movement hypothesis, {IMH}). I challenged the generality of {IMH} by comparing foraging behavior and frequency of tail displays across five Acanthodactylus lizards that vary in fundamental life history traits, before and after the tail changed color. As these species underwent changes in tail coloration, they congruently adopted less risky behaviors and reduced the frequencies of tail displays. Contrary to expectation, in two species, the hatchling risky behavior resulted not from increased movements but from longer stay in exposed microhabitats. I suggest that colorful tails and deflective tail displays are synergistic antipredator mechanisms neonates use to minimize the fitness consequences of using various risky behaviors rather than increased movement alone.},

Aqueous {NH}4HCO3 solutions were reacted with C2H2, H-2, and O2 (formed in situ from {CaC}2, Ca, and H2O2) at 200-275-degrees-C over 0.2-2 h periods to synthesize several amino acids and abundant amines. These amino acid and amine producing reactions were not observed to occur below 150-degrees-C. Amino acids and amines also were synthesized at 210-degrees-C from solutions of {NH}4OH, {HCHO}, {NaCN}, and H-2. When {NH}4OH was replaced by {NH}4HCO3, the syntheses predominantly confirmed the recent results of {HENNET} et al. (1992). Additionally, amino acids and amines were observed to form by reactions among {NH}4OH, {HCHO}, and H-2 at hydrothermal conditions, essentially confirming the results of Fox and {WINDSOR} (1970). Inclusion of both carbonate and O2 in these latter solutions greatly enhanced the production rate of amino acids. The amines synthesized hydrothermally could be significant if they are precursors in the amino acid syntheses either at hydrothermal or later at lower temperatures. These observations provide additional input to the current questions of synthesis, stability, and decomposition of amino acids at hydrothermal conditions, and their possible relevance to the origin of life.},

A combination of nanostructure in the scales, which reflect or scatter light, and absorption from chemical pigments in the scales and wing substrate create the final colour appearance. We compared the wing scale morphology of the pierid butterfly Pieris rapae (Small White) to the reflectance spectra from its wings. Its wing scales contain a dense array of pterin pigment beads. A positive correlation between bead-array density and wing reflectance, at wavelengths where the pigment does not absorb, was identified and characterised. We observed, however, that light scatter from these beads does not account for all of the broadband light scatter observed from the wings. The rest of the scale structure plays an important role in achieving high light scatter. Furthermore, combining the underlying scattering and absorption mechanisms within the butterfly scales enabled us to quantify the optical characteristics of the samples using {CIELab} colour theory.

In particular, elevational changes in habitat structure and climate not only covary with intensity of sexual selection in many taxa, but may also influence evolution of mating signals. Here we examined variation in courtship song in relation to elevation of breeding across cardueline finches-a subfamily of birds that occupies the widest elevational range of extant birds and shows extensive variation in life histories and sexual selection along this range. We predicted that decrease in sexual selection intensity with elevation of breeding documented in this clade would result in a corresponding evolutionary reduction in elaboration of courtship songs. We controlled for the effects of phylogeny, morphology, and habitat structure to uncover a predicted elevational decline in courtship song elaboration; species breeding at lower elevations sang more elaborated and louder songs compared to their sister species breeding at higher elevations. In addition, lower elevation species had longer songs with more notes, whereas frequency components of song did not vary with elevation. We suggest that changes in sexual selection account for the observed patterns of song variation and discuss how elevational gradient in sexual selection may facilitate divergence in mating signals potentially reinforcing or promoting speciation.},

Recent comparative genomics studies of Wolbachia strains have revealed putative candidate genes involved in the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) in insects. However the functional testing of these genes is hindered by the lack of available genetic tools in Wolbachia. To circumvent this problem we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing various Wolbachia {CI} candidate genes under the control of the {GAL}4/{UAS} system in order to evaluate their possible role in Wolbachia-related phenotypes in Drosophila. The expression of a number of these genes in Drosophila melanogaster failed to mimic or alter {CI} phenotypes across a range of Wolbachia backgrounds or in the absence of Wolbachia.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection may explain why secondary sexual traits of males are so strongly developed in some species that they seem maladaptive. Female mate choice appears to favor the evolution of conspicuous color patterns in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from Trinidad, but color patterns vary strikingly among populations. According to most theory, correlated evolution of female mating preferences and preferred male traits within populations could promote this kind of divergence between populations. But mating preferences could also constrain the evolution of male traits. In some guppy populations, females discriminate among males based on variation in the extent of orange pigment in male color patterns, and populations differ significantly in the degree offemale preferences for orange area. In a comparison ofseven populations, the degree offemale preference based on orange is correlated with the population average orange area. Thus male traits and female preferences appear to be evolving in parallel.},

However, a hypothesis posits that the production of structural colouration depends on developmental stability because variation in developmental programs can affect the precise feather structures that generate structural colour. Here, I test this hypothesis by exploring the relationship between crown colouration, calculated by using a model of avian visual perception, and fluctuating asymmetry ({FA}) of tail feathers in Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). As predicted, there was a negative correlation between the ultraviolet ({UV})-blue reflectance of the crown patch and {FA} of feathers. There was indirect evidence for a relationship between fledging success and {UV}-blue colour, but not for a condition dependence of this trait. These results suggest that the signal content of the structural colouration of Blue Tits may be information regarding individuals' developmental stability. As the colour components of the crown colouration were calculated with an avian visual perception model, this indicates that Blue Tits can perceive differences in {FA} through variation in the expression of structural colour.},

	abstract = {The rich biodiversity of southern Africa has to date been relatively unimpacted by the activities of modern society, but to what degree will this situation persist into the 21st century? We use a leading global environmental assessment model ({IMAGE}) to explore future land use and climate change in southern Africa under the scenarios developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We assess the impacts on terrestrial biodiversity using the Biodiversity Intactness Index, which gives the average change in population size relative to the pre-modern state, across all terrestrial species of plants and vertebrates. Over the coming century, we project absolute declines in the average population sizes of these taxa that are two to three times greater than the reductions that have occurred since circa 1700. Our results highlight the immense challenges faced by efforts to reduce rates of biodiversity loss in southern Africa, even under relatively optimistic scenarios. These results stress the urgent need for better aligning biodiversity conservation and development priorities in the region. Furthermore, we suggest that context-sensitive conservation targets that account for the development imperatives in different parts of the region are needed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Continuous-time models for the behaviour of one and two strains of Wolbachia within a single well-mixed population demonstrate the Allee effect and founder control, such that one strain is always driven extinct. In contrast, discretised spatial models show patchy persistence of the two strains although coexistence within the same habitat is rare.

	abstract = {Life appears to be a natural property of matter, but the problem of its origin only arose after early scientists refuted continuous spontaneous generation. There is no chance of life arising,all at once', we need the standard scientific incremental explanation with large numbers of small steps, an approach used in both physical and evolutionary sciences. The necessity for considering both theoretical and experimental approaches is emphasized. After describing basic principles that are available (including the Darwin-Eigen cycle), the search for origins is considered under four main themes. These are the {RNA}-world hypothesis; potential intermediates between an {RNA}-world and a modern world via the evolution of protein synthesis and then of {DNA}; possible alternatives to an {RNA}-world; and finally the earliest stages from the simple prebiotic systems to {RNA}. The triplicase/proto-ribosome theory for the origin of the ribosome is discussed where triples of nucleotides are added to a replicating {RNA}, with the origin of a triplet code well-before protein synthesis begins. The length of the code is suggested to arise from the early development of a ratchet mechanism that overcomes the problem of continued processivity of an {RNA}-based {RNA}-polymerase. It is probable that there were precursor stages to {RNA} with simpler sugars, or just two nucleotides, but we do not yet know of any better alternatives to {RNA} that were likely to arise naturally. For prebiotic stages (before {RNA}) a flow-reactor model is suggested to solve metabolism, energy gradients, and compartmentation simultaneously - thus the intense interest in some form of flow reactor. If an autocatalytic cycle could arise in such a system we would be major steps ahead. The most likely physical conditions for the origin of life require further clarification and it is still unclear whether the origin of life is more of an entropy (information) problem (and therefore high temperatures would be detrimental), rather than a kinetic problem (where high temperatures may be advantageous).},

A series of ecologically relevant tasks, involving a behavioural paradigm of discrimination learning in semi-natural conditions and the usage of ecologically relevant stimuli, was executed. Three marmosets, 2 males and a female, behaved like human dichromats, showing an impaired performance when orange and green stimuli had to be discriminated. In contrast, 2 females resembled human trichromats, discriminating those kinds of pairs.

	abstract = {Floral color change has been recognized as a pollination strategy, but its relative effectiveness has been evaluated insufficiently with respect to other floral traits. In this study, effects of floral color change on the visitation pattern of bumblebees were empirically assessed using artificial flowers. Four inflorescence types were postulated as strategies of flowering behavior: type 1 has no retention of old flowers, resulting in a small display size; type 2 retains old flowers without nectar production; type 3 retains old flowers with nectar; and type 4 retains color-changed old flowers without nectar. Effects of these treatments varied depending on both the total display size (single versus multiple inflorescences) and the pattern of flower-opening. In the single inflorescence experiment, a large floral display due to the retention of old flowers (types 2-4) enhanced pollinator attraction, and the number of flower visits per stay decreased with color change (type 4), suggesting a decrease in geitonogamous pollination. Type-4 plants also reduced the foraging time of bees in comparison with type-2 plants. In the multiple inflorescence experiment, the retention of old flowers did not contribute to pollinator attraction. When flowering occurred sequentially within inflorescences, type-4 plants successfully decreased the number of visits and the foraging time in comparison with type-2 plants. In contrast, floral color change did not influence the number of visits, and it extended the foraging time when flowering occurred simultaneously within inflorescences but the opening of inflorescences progressed sequentially within a plant. Therefore, the effectiveness of floral color change is highly susceptible to the display size and flowering pattern within plants, and this may limit the versatility of the color change strategy in nature.},

	abstract = {Divergent selection on traits involved in both local adaptation and the production of mating signals can strongly facilitate population differentiation. Because of its links to foraging morphologies and cultural inheritance song of birds can contribute particularly strongly to maintenance of local adaptations. In two adjacent habitats-native Sonoran desert and urban areas-house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) forage on seeds that are highly distinct in size and shell hardness and require different bite forces and bill morphologies. Here, we first document strong and habitat-specific natural selection on bill traits linked to bite force and find adaptive modifications of bite force and bill morphology and associated divergence in courtship song between the two habitats. Second, we investigate the developmental basis of this divergence and find that early ontogenetic tissue transformation in bill, but not skeletal traits, is accelerated in the urban population and that the mandibular primordia of the large-beaked urban finches express bone morphogenetic proteins ({BMP}) earlier and at higher level than those of the desert finches. Further, we show that despite being geographically adjacent, urban and desert populations are nevertheless genetically distinct corroborating findings of early developmental divergence between them. Taken together, these results suggest that divergent selection on function and development of traits involved in production of mating signals, in combination with localized learning of such signals, can be very effective at maintaining local adaptations, even at small spatial scales and in highly mobile animals.},

We performed an experimental manipulation of T levels and examined the effects on the yellow carotenoid-based breast plumage in captive yearling blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, of which half received a diet supplemented with carotenoids. T treatment resulted in elevated plasma T compared to controls and carotenoid supplementation strongly increased plasma carotenoid levels. T treatment resulted in an additional increase in plasma carotenoid levels but only in the carotenoid-supplemented males. Carotenoid supplementation resulted in more intense breast colour (carotenoid chroma), as expected. However, there was no effect of testosterone on plumage coloration at either dietary carotenoid level. Our results suggest that T can cause an increase in plasma carotenoid concentration, but that this does not necessarily lead to improved carotenoid-based plumage coloration.},

Here we present an unbiased assessment of plumage dichromatism in the yellow-breasted chat Icteria virens. Chats exhibit yellow to orange throat and breast plumage that to the unaided human observer differs only subtly in color. Spectrophotometric analyses revealed that chat throat and breast feathers exhibited reflective curves with two peaks, one in the ultraviolet and one in the yellow end of the spectrum. We found differences in both the shape and magnitude of reflectance curves between males and females. Moreover, for feathers collected from the lower edge and middle of the breast patch, male plumage reflected more light in the ultraviolet and yellow wavelengths compared to females, whereas male throat feathers appeared brighter than those of females only in the ultraviolet. Biochemical analyses indicated that the plumage pigmentation consisted solely of the carotenoid all-trans lutein and we found that males have higher concentrations of plumage carotenoids than females. Feathers that were naturally unpigmented reflected more {UV} light than yellow feathers, suggesting a potential role of feather microstructure in {UV} reflectance.},

Until recently, however, efforts to evaluate this prediction have suffered from either a purely correlational (nonmanipulative) approach, or from using manipulations of doubtful ecological relevance. Here I address these issues by integrating observation and manipulation to study condition- and sex-related color variation in a butterfly. The focal species, Eurema hecabe (Pieridae), possesses three sexually homologous and morphogenetically discrete dorsal wing color elements—coherently scattered ultraviolet ({UV}), pteridine yellow, and melaninic black. The {UV} is most strongly sexually selected, and is also the only color element with restricted distribution across female wings. Condition dependence and sexual dichromatism were pervasive, characterizing all color traits except the melanic black, and acting such that low condition males resembled high condition females. Although female coloration tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation, size-scaled {UV} was more variable and condition dependent in males. Importantly, manipulation of larval resources was sufficient to closely reconstruct the extent and patterns of field-observed phenotypic variation in condition, and color trait expression, which implicates larval resource acquisition as a primary driver of condition dependence. These results support theories regarding phenotypic variation in sexually selected traits. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Abstract: Reproduction in plants often requires animal vectors. Fruit and flower colors are traditionally viewed as an adaptation to facilitate detection for pollinators and seed dispersers. This longstanding hypothesis predicts that fruits are easier to detect against their own leaves compared with those of different species. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the chromatic contrasts between 130 bird‐dispersed fruits and their respective backgrounds according to avian vision. From a bird’s view, fruits are not more contrasting to their own background than to those of other plant species. Fruit colors are therefore not adapted toward maximized conspicuousness for avian seed dispersers. However, secondary structures associated with fruit displays increase their contrasts. We used fruit colors to assess whether the ultraviolet and violet types of avian visual systems are equally efficient in detecting color signals. In bright light, the chromatic contrasts between fruit and background are stronger for ultraviolet vision. This advantage is due to the lesser overlap in spectral sensitivities of the blue and ultraviolet cones, which disappears in dim light conditions. We suggest that passerines with ultraviolet cones might primarily use epigamic signals that are less conspicuous to their avian predators (presumably with violet vision). Possible examples for such signals are carotenoid‐based signals.},

By scoring phenotypes and wing expression of five genes in 399 and 21 nymphalid species, respectively, we tested when eyespots and expression of their associated genes evolved. We found that the origin of eyespots was concurrent with the origin of the gene expression patterns, approximately 90 million years ago. Following this event, many genes expressed in eyespot development were lost in some lineages without a corresponding loss of eyespots, indicating substantial evolution in the cluster of genes associated with eyespots. This finding suggests that complex traits such as butterfly eyespots may initially evolve by re-deploying pre-existing gene regulatory networks, which are subsequently trimmed of genes that are unnecessary in the novel context.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Over the past decade, use of objective methods for assessing color has increased, with particular emphasis on ultraviolet ({UV}) wavelengths. Researchers have used various source materials, most notably museum specimens, to extend or represent color measurements of individuals in natural populations. Here, we address whether the colors seen in museum specimens accurately represent the colors seen in natural populations. We focus on {UV} wavelengths and carotenoid-derived colors across 10 species of wood-warblers (Parulidae). Our results indicate an uneven decrease in brightness across the color spectrum, with greater relative decrease in shorter wavelengths in museum specimens. That decrease leads to differences in both hue and chroma between living and museum specimens. The difference from live specimens appears to increase with the museum specimen's age. Our results suggest that caution is needed when using data from museum specimens to test hypotheses on plumage coloration, particularly those involving communication.},

	abstract = {Female ornamentation was initially thought to reflect genetic correlation with the more elaborate male trait. However, this cannot explain female-specific ornamentation, such as the conspicuous coloration displayed by females of many species during breeding. Females may exhibit distinctive, reproductive coloration to 1) advertise receptivity and stimulate male courtship or 2) advertise nonreceptivity when gravid to reduce male courtship, harassment, and potentially costly copulations. We tested both hypotheses in the Lake Eyre dragon lizard (Ctenophorus maculosus) by quantifying female coloration, using spectroradiometry and a model of lizard color perception, and male and female behavior across the female reproductive cycle. Females develop bright orange coloration on their throat and abdomen during the breeding season, whereas males remain cryptically colored. The onset of orange coloration was associated with enlarging follicles, acceptance of copulations, and escalation of male courtship. Rather than fading once females were no longer receptive, however, the intense orange coloration remained until oviposition. Furthermore, despite maximal coloration associated with nonreceptivity, males persisted with courtship and copulation attempts, and females increased rejection behaviors comprising lateral displays and flipping onto their backs (to prevent forced intromission), both of which emphasize the conspicuous ventrolateral coloration. These apparently costly rejection behaviors did not reduce male harassment but did decrease the frequency of potentially costly copulations. These results suggest that 1) males do not determine female receptivity based on coloration alone and 2) the potentially costly rejection behaviors may have evolved to reduce the direct costs of mating.},

Membrane vesicles were inflated with alkaline, sulphide-bearing hydrothermal ({\textless}200-degrees-C) solution and grew on a submarine sulphide mound in acid iron-bearing Hadean seawater. Once a critical size had been reached (0.1-1 mm) vesicles would have budded contiguous self-similar daughters. We assume that the membrane was rendered insulating by the adsorption and/or oxidative precipitation of organic and organosulphur compounds. As a consequence of the naturally induced proton-motive (chemiosmotic) force, and the activity of the iron monosulphide redox catalysts within the membrane, organic compounds would have accumulated within the vesicle. Osmotically driven growth therefore became more significant with time. The geochemical environment envisaged as responsible for this first step towards life is consistent with that widely accepted for the early Earth.},

	abstract = {Variation among females in mate choice may influence evolution by sexual selection. The genetic basis of this variation is of interest because the elaboration of mating preferences requires additive genetic variation in these traits. Here we measure the repeatability and heritability of two components of female choosiness (responsiveness and discrimination) and of female preference functions for the multiple ornaments borne by male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We show that there is significant repeatable variation in both components of choosiness and in some preference functions but not in others. There appear to be several male ornaments that females find uniformly attractive and others for which females differ in preference. One consequence is that there is no universally attractive male phenotype. Only responsiveness shows significant additive genetic variation. Variation in responsiveness appears to mask variation in discrimination and some preference functions and may be the most biologically relevant source of phenotypic and genetic variation in mate-choice behavior. To test the potential evolutionary importance of the phenotypic variation in mate choice that we report, we estimated the opportunity for and the intensity of sexual selection under models of mate choice that excluded and that incorporated individual female variation. We then compared these estimates with estimates based on measured mating success. Incorporating individual variation in mate choice generally did not predict the outcome of sexual selection any better than models that ignored such variation.},

To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, we measured {DNA} sequence divergence around putatively introgressed mimicry loci and compared this with the rest of the genome. Our results reveal that putatively introgressed regions show strongly reduced sequence divergence between co-mimetic species, suggesting that their divergence times are younger than the rest of the genome. This is consistent with introgression and not ancestral variation. We further show that this signature of introgression occurs at sites throughout the genome, not just around mimicry genes.},

Here, we apply a photoreceptor noise-limited colour opponent model of avian perception to assess a necessary corollary of any intraspecific signalling hypothesis, namely that individual birds are able to discriminate between colours of eggs in different conspecific clutches. Clutches from 46 species in the superfamily Muscicapoidea were measured at the Natural History Museum collection in Tring, {UK}. The results demonstrate that, for these particular species, most eggs are predicted not to be easily discriminable from those in other conspecific clutches in terms of the shells' background coloration. These findings are of fundamental concern to any signalling hypothesis that looks to explain the evolution of avian-visible egg colour polymorphism through selection at the intraspecific level. Importantly, future studies should combine both the proximate mechanisms and the ultimate functions of trait variability when testing hypotheses of the variability in eggshell appearance.},

Here, we model transitions between these states, examining the evolution of mutants of {CI} strains that retain both the ability to induce and resist {CI} but, in addition, cause sex ratio distortion. The model shows that {CI} strains are highly susceptible to invasion and subsequent elimination by these mutants. For all three types of sex ratio distortion, there is some parameter space in which the strain showing sex ratio distortion becomes extinct following exclusion of the progenitor {CI} strain, leaving the population uninfected. Extinction of the new Wolbachia strain is common for the case of male killing but rarer for parthenogenesis induction and feminization. Our models predict that {CI} strains of Wolbachia will occur most commonly in hosts that are male heterogametic, where there is little interaction between siblings because these hosts are unlikely to favor the spread of male killing, feminization, or parthenogenesis induction. The models raise the question of why {CI} strains apparently predominate in nature, and it is suggested that this is a result of either fewer restrictions on {CI} strains spreading through novel host populations or restrictions to the mutability of Wolbachia strains.},

	abstract = {Frequency-dependent mating behaviour has the potential to maintain genetic variation in characteristics of organisms. The colour patterns of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) provide an example of one of the most extreme genetically based polymorphisms known in nature, for which frequency-dependent mate choice could be a mechanism. Numerous studies have shown that female guppies base mating preferences on male colour patterns and there is evidence that females prefer to mate with males displaying novel or unfamiliar colour patterns. This preference could lead to frequency-dependent mating success in males. Nevertheless, the possibility that female sexual responsiveness itself may depend on the frequency of male types has not been tested systematically in guppies or any other species. This study examined the sexual responses of female guppies in experimental groups consisting of two males with similar (redundant) and two males with different (unique) colour patterns. We found that female guppies were much more likely to respond sexually to the displays of unique males than to those of redundant males. Further, there was no effect of orange colouration on female responsiveness as has been documented for this population in several previous studies, thus, discrimination against redundant male types appears to have overridden directional selection based on colour pattern characteristics. This discrimination against redundant male types could in turn lead to frequency-dependent mating success in males and maintenance of colour pattern polymorphism.},

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based skin colorations vary seasonally in many bird species and are thought to be honest sexually selected signals. In order to provide more insight in the potential signal function and underlying mechanisms of such colorations we here quantified patterns of variation of leg coloration in adult male and female Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus tinnunculus) over the breeding season, and evaluated the relationship between coloration and levels of carotenoids, androgens and estrogens, oxidative damage and plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity. We studied both reproducing wild and non-reproducing captive birds to test for the effect of diet and breeding effort. Males were more colored than females only during mating, and independently of diet, suggesting that leg-color is a sexually selected trait. Seasonal variation in leg color was associated with circulating carotenoids, but concentrations of these molecules were not related to antioxidant capacity, body condition or oxidative damage. These results indicate that carotenoid-based colorations may not be an honest signal of health status in this species. Production of carotenoid rich eggs coincided with low levels of circulating carotenoids in females, indicating that carotenoids might be a limited resource for laying female kestrels. Finally, young rearing males had higher levels of oxidative damage than females, and wild birds of both sexes had higher levels of these parameters than captive birds. These results may indicate that parental effort and physical activity are costly, independently from hormonal status. Since androgens did not explain carotenoid variation we suggest that multiple interacting factors can regulate carotenoid levels along the season. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Most studies of crypsis, aposematism, sexual selection, or other forms of signalling concentrate on one or two patch classes (colours), either ignoring the rest of the colour pattern, or analysing the patches separately. We summarize methods of comparing colour patterns making use of known properties of bird eyes. The methods are easily modifiable for other animal visual systems. We present a new statistical method to compare entire colour patterns rather than comparing multiple pairs of patches. Unlike previous methods, the new method detects differences in the relationships among the colours, not just differences in colours. We present tests of the method's ability to detect a variety of kinds of differences between natural colour patterns and provide suggestions for analysis.

We investigated three lekking birds at Nourages field station, French Guiana: Rupicola rupicola, Corapipo gutturalis, and Lepidothrix serena. Conspicuousness is a function of ambient light spectra during displays and the reflectance spectra of color pattern elements of the birds and their visual backgrounds. Each species places its lek and performs its lek displays in only one or two of the available light environments, and some may specialize in the more extreme spectra even within each light environment. The color patterns and behavior of each species maximize its visual contrast during its display and reduce it off the lek or on the lek but not displaying. Each species does this with a different combination of colors and light environments. If this phenomenon is general, then it has important implications for the evolution of color patterns and display behavior.},

We tested this assumption by staging dyadic encounters between male field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, under three conditions: (i) both males could sing aggressive songs, (ii) neither male could sing, and (iii) one male could sing but the other could not. We conducted experiments on males from a Hawaiian population from Kauai that has recently evolved signal loss, and males from a Hawaiian population from the Big Island that has not. Among both populations, interactions between two silent males were characterized by higher levels of aggression than interactions involving one or two singing males. Because the level of aggression is strongly related to the cost of fighting, these data demonstrate that signalling mitigates the cost of fighting. In mixed trials, we found no statistically significant differences between the behaviour of calling and non-calling males in either population. We conclude that there is no evidence that the Kauai population exhibits special adaptations to alleviate the costs of signal loss. Finally, we found that males were much more likely to signal after their opponent's retreat than after their own retreat. Aggressive song therefore meets the definition of a victory display'.},

This organic matter contributed to the organic inventory available for chemical reactions on the early Earth and may have played a role in the origin of life. Carbonaceous chondrites contain up to 5\% by weight of organic matter, including important prebiotic molecules. The majority of the organic matter in carbonaceous chondrites (some 70-90\%) occurs as complex, cross-linked macromolecular materials. These macromolecular materials may have had a role in the prebiotic chemistry of the primitive Earth. We have undertaken a series of experiments involving the hydrous pyrolysis of macromolecular materials from the Murchison ({CM}2) meteorite aimed at investigating the fate of extraterrestrial macromolecules on 'wet' planets such as the Earth. Our experiments solubilised 55\% of the carbon in the macromolecular materials. Thus, an order of magnitude more free organic compounds can be generated by hydrothermal processing of macromolecular materials than are available as free compounds within the bulk meteorite. The major products were alkyl-substituted benzenes, naphthalenes and indanes, alkyl-substituted thiophenes and benzothiophenes, and alkyl-substituted phenols. The pyrolysis products are comparable to those compounds present as free entities in Murchison, though with substantially increased abundances of phenols and thiophenes. Similar macromolecular material-derived compounds may have contributed to the organic inventory available for prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth.},

A previous study indicated that the major female ostrich recognises her own eggs and selectively evicts eggs of minor females based on size, shape and shell texture. Our aim was to investigate if accepted and ejected eggs differ in colour characteristics. We quantified colour by measuring egg reflectance spectra, which were subsequently analysed using a visual model approach.

Our goal was to examine the seasonal variation of the net carbon dioxide exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere and to understand the relative contributions of the vegetation and rhizosphere to these fluxes. Over the course of the growing season the jack pine stand was a small, net sink of carbon dioxide-47 {gCm}(-2) were assimilated during a 115 day period between spring (day 144) and autumn (day 259). On a daily basis, the magnitude of the net uptake of {CO}2 by the forest was relatively small, less than 4 {gCm}(-2) day(-1). We also observed many days when carbon dioxide was lost from the forest stand (up to 2 {gCm}(-2) day(-1)), Day to day sums of net carbon dioxide exchange exhibited little seasonality, despite the seasonality experienced by controlling environmental and biological variables. The aseasonality of net canopy {CO}2 exchange occurred because temporal variations associated with canopy photosynthesis and plant and microbial respiration offset one another over the growing season. Canopy photosynthesis rates of the jack pine stand were evaluated using {CO}2 flux measurements made above and below the canopy. Daily totals of canopy photosynthesis were a linear function of available solar energy and exhibited a quadratic dependence on temperature, with optimum photosynthesis occurring between 15 and 25 degrees C. We also observed that the net daily uptake of carbon dioxide was independent of soil moisture in the upper 0.15 m of the soil profile, despite the wide range of soil moisture that was experienced. Finally, the net gain of carbon by a jack pine canopy came with a relatively large respiratory expense. On average, 68\% of the carbon gained by photosynthesis was consumed by plant respiration, over the course of a day.},

	abstract = {The coevolution of extravagant male traits and female mate preferences is a central tenet of sexual selection theory. In lineages in which males have developed more elaborate sexual characters, females favour the most extreme expression of the trait. In some taxa, however, ornamental displays have evolved from more to less exaggerated states. Under these circumstances, it is unclear whether females show preferences for an ancestral male condition or for the current, less elaborate display. Here, we tested female mate preferences relative to male ornamental coloration in two species of cardueline finch (the American goldfinch, Carduelis tristis, and pine siskin, Carduelis pinus) that have evolved less elaborate carotenoid-based colour displays from more elaborately coloured ancestral states. We presented females of each species with a choice of males having either large patches of red colour (the elaborate, ancestral condition) or with species-typical patches of yellow colour (the less elaborate, derived state). Female goldfinches and siskins showed consistent preferences for the natural colour displays of males, and not for the more elaborate, ancestral colour pattern. Previous research on another cardueline finch taxon (a subspecies of the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus griscomi), however, showed that females prefer more elaborate, ancestral coloration to the current form of reduced colour expression. The lack of congruence between male trait expression and female trait preference in the lineage with the most recently derived reduction in trait expression suggests that there may be evolutionary lags in the correspondence between male traits and female preferences. A shift in the expression of male coloration appears to be the first step towards the evolution of reduced colour displays in these finches.

	abstract = {Plovers and their allies exhibit an impressive diversity of melanin-based plumage patterns ranging from non-melanized to completely melanized species. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether melanization has evolved in relation to sexual selection for attracting mates, to selection for signalling territory defence, or to natural selection for camouflage. First, according to sexual-selection theory, melanized plumage has evolved to amplify the courtship displays of males. As predicted by this hypothesis, we found that males with aerial displays had more melanized plumage than males of ground-displaying species. In addition, sexual dimorphism in melanization was greater in species with display flights than in species with ground displays. Second, melanization may have evolved through social interactions to signal competitive ability in territory defence. We did not find evidence for this hypothesis, since breeding density was unrelated to the melanization of either sex. Finally, melanized plumage may camouflage the incubating parent. The latter hypothesis was not supported, since melanization was unrelated either to the darkness of nest substrate or the extent of vegetation cover. Taken together, our results are most consistent with the sexual-selection hypothesis, and suggest that melanized plumage has evolved to enhance the aerial displays of male plovers.},

	abstract = {Nectar-feeding insects find flowers by 2 means, innate preferences and learned associations. When insects that hibernate as imagos (i.e., adults) start foraging after a long winter break, what guides them to new nectar rewards? Are innate preferences kept over such a long period? And are learned associations useful after long breaks? In a series of experiments I show here that, depending on previous experience, the European hummingbird hawkmoth, Macroglossum stellatarum can use both types of information to choose a first flower after periods of 1 or 3 weeks. What is remembered seems to depend on innate preferences of the moths. Moths trained to feed from 1 of 2 colors that are equally attractive to naive moths keep the learned preference. Animals trained to prefer a less attractive color to an innately preferred color loose the learned preference and return to the innate choice behavior. I conclude that hummingbird hawkmoths can keep innate and learned preferences over a long period and are able to use both types of information when searching nectar rewards after long periods of hibernation.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance has been implicated in mate selection. Yet, in some bird species the plumage of young varies in {UV} reflectance already in the nest and long before mate choice and sexual selection come into play. Most birds molt the juvenile body plumage before reaching sexual maturity, and thus, some conspicuous traits of the juvenile body plumage may rather have evolved by natural selection, possibly via predation or parental preference. This second hypothesis is largely untested and predicts a differential allocation of food between fledging and total independence, which is a time period of 2-3 weeks where offspring mortality is also highest. Here, we test the prediction that parents use the individual variation in {UV} reflectance among fledglings for differential food allocation. We manipulated {UV} reflectance of the plumage of fledgling great tits Parus major by treating chest and cheek feathers with a lotion that either did or did not contain {UV} blockers and then recorded food allocation by parents in an outdoor design simulating postfledging conditions. The visible spectrum was minimally affected by this treatment. Females were found to feed {UV}-reflecting offspring preferentially, whereas males had no preference. It is the first evidence showing that the {UV} reflectance of the feathers of young birds has a signaling function in parent-offspring communication and suggests that the {UV} traits evolved via parental preference.},

We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of {TEMs} of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths. Previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent, Tyndall scattering, the scales of Papilio zalmoxis are not appropriately nanostructured for incoherent scattering. Rather, available data indicate that the blue of P. zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour. Despite their nanoscale anatomical diversity, all structurally coloured butterfly scales share a single fundamental physical color production mechanism - coherent scattering. Recognition of this commonality provides a new perspective on how the nanostructure and optical properties of structurally coloured butterfly scales evolved and diversified among and within lepidopteran clades.},

To establish the importance of signal efficacy requires evidence that both signals and their detectability to receivers have evolved in response to habitat shifts in a predictable fashion. Here, we test whether habitat structure has predictable effects on the evolution of male and female display coloration in 21 lineages of African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion), based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis. We used quantitative measures of display coloration and estimated signal detectability as the contrast of those colors among body regions or against the background vegetation as perceived by the chameleon visual system. Both male and female display colors varied predictably with different aspects of habitat structure. In several (but not all) instances, habitat-associated shifts in display coloration resulted in habitat-associated variation in detectability. While males exhibit a remarkable variety of colors and patterns, female display coloration is highly conserved, consisting in all populations of contrasting dark and light elements. This color pattern may maximize detectability across all habitat types, potentially explaining female conservatism. Overall, our results support the view that selection for signal efficacy plays an important role in the evolution of animal signals.},

Condition capture models assume that only animals in superior condition can develop and maintain a colorful plumage. Although there is good evidence that carotenoid-based components of plumage colors show condition dependence, the situation is more controversial with the underlying {UV}-reflecting structural component. We conducted a brood size manipulation in blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to investigate condition-dependent effects on plumage coloration in male and female offspring. Carotenoid chroma and {UV} reflectance of the yellow breast plumage showed condition-dependent expression in male and female fledglings. However, only males that were raised in reduced broods had higher {UV} reflectance in the {UV}/blue tail feathers, whereas female tail coloration did not differ between treatments. Our data suggest that there is a sex-specific effect on the blue but not the yellow plumage and that this is related to differences in the signaling function of both plumage traits. Although sexual selection may already act on male nestlings to develop colorful tail feathers for the next breeding season, the {UV}/yellow breast feathers are molted during the postjuvenile molt, and their signaling value is likely to be important for both sexes during the extended postfledgling phase.},

This paper highlights the need to plan reliable diversity analysis based on a good understanding of the relevant theory. The quantitative values of indices obtained should be used as the basis for planning only after a critical and qualitative interpretation of such indices by professional ecologists and considering local features, history, constraints and the human disturbances affecting the ecological units studied.

We discovered that the proboscis promotes capillary pull of liquids from diverse sources owing to a hierarchical pore structure spanning nano- and microscales. X-ray phase-contrast imaging reveals that Plateau instability causes liquid bridges to form in the food canal, which are transported to the gut by the muscular sucking pump in the head. The dual functionality of the proboscis represents a key innovation for exploiting a vast range of nutritional sources. We suggest that future studies of the adaptive radiation of the Lepidoptera take into account the role played by the structural organization of the proboscis. A transformative two-step model of capillary intake and suctioning can be applied not only to butterflies and moths but also potentially to vast numbers of other insects such as bees and flies.},

Antioxidants (e.g. carotenoids, vitamins) are also abundant in the egg yolk, which serve as nutrient reserves for the developing embryo, and eggshell colour intensity may reflect maternal investment in yolk antioxidants. Here, we test the relationship between blue-green eggshell colour intensity and concentration and amount of carotenoids, vitamin A, and vitamin E in the egg yolk of spotless starling Sturnus unicolor, a species for which we have previously shown good evidence of sexual selection driving egg coloration. As could be extrapolated from the hypothesis of sexual selection driving the evolution of blue-green eggshells, we found that eggshell colour intensity was positively related to the concentration and amount of carotenoids and vitamin E in the yolk. Thus, mothers may use egg colour intensity to signal to fathers the antioxidant status of their offspring. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that maternal yolk investment in more coloured eggs can also explain the detected association between feeding decisions of males and egg colour intensity that we have found previously in this species.},

However, the role of these hormones in regulating prenuptial moult and male plumage signals of passerine birds is unclear. In the red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus melanocephalus, plumage colour is a sexually selected trait and males express three reproductive phenotypes: males can breed in bright red and black plumage or in dull brown plumage, or assume dull plumage and act as nonbreeding auxiliaries; each phenotype differs in parental and reproductive behaviour. We found that plasma androgen concentrations differed significantly between male phenotypes, with red/black breeding males having the highest levels and auxiliaries having the lowest levels across all nesting stages. These hormonal differences were also present during the prebreeding moult when nuptial plumage is acquired. Males also differed significantly in body condition during moult based on the phenotype acquired in the subsequent breeding season, with red/black breeding males being in the best condition and auxiliaries being in the poorest condition. Moreover, androgen concentrations were positively correlated with body condition during prenuptial moult.

	abstract = {Red hues are a challenge in studies on the evolution of bird coloration, as multiple pigments such as carotenoids, pheomelanin, psittacofulvins, porphyrins, turacin, haemoglobin and even exogenous iron-oxides, may confer red colors. Determining the pigment type is paramount and here we investigate the differences in spectrum reflectance for six pigments resulting in red colorations in feathers of different species, with a focus on discriminating among melanins and carotenoids. Pigment chemical identification was obtained from the literature or using High Performance Liquid Chromatography ({HPLC}) in our laboratory. We have also derived discriminant formulas for identification of the major known types of pigments based on parameters of the reflectance curves obtained with a portable spectrometer. Our results indicate that the reflectance patterns of coloration perceived as red patches widely differ. The distinction between carotenoid- and melanin-based reflectance curves is relatively straightforward: sigmoid versus straight slope. The spectral reflectance curves of feathers containing red psittacofulvins are sigmoid, whereas iron oxide and porphyrin-containing feathers recall pheomelanins in rendering a straight slope. In the case of turacin-based coloration, the spectral shape is unique. For the pigments with enough number of species sampled (i.e., carotenoids, melanins and psittacofulvins) the differences in reflectance shape are important enough to allow separation of carotenoid and melanin derived colorations based on reflectance curves alone.

	abstract = {Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that infect a large number of insects and are responsible for different reproductive alterations of their hosts. One of the key features of Wolbachia biology is its ability to move within and between host species, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts. Using multiple Wolbachia genes, including five developed for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing ({MLST}), the diversity and modes of movement of Wolbachia within the wasp genus Nasonia were investigated. Eleven different Wolbachia were found in the four species of Nasonia, including five newly identified infections. Five infections were acquired by horizontal transmission from other insect taxa, three have been acquired by hybridization between two Nasonia species, which resulted in a mitochondrial- Wolbachia sweep from one species to the other, and at least three have codiverged during speciation of their hosts. The results show that a variety of transfer mechanisms of Wolbachia are possible even within a single host genus. Codivergence of Wolbachia and their hosts is uncommon and provides a rare opportunity to investigate long-term Wolbachia evolution within a host lineage. Using synonymous divergence among codiverging infections and host nuclear genes, we estimate Wolbachia mutation rates to be approximately one-third that of the nuclear genome.

	abstract = {Wolbachia strains are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that infect many arthropod species and have evolved several different ways of manipulating their hosts, the most frequent way being cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}). {CI} leads to embryo death in crosses between infected males and uninfected females as well as in crosses between individuals infected by incompatible Wolbachia strains. The mosquito Culex pipiens exhibits the highest crossing type variability reported so far. Our crossing data support the notion that {CI} might be driven by at least two distinct genetic units that control the {CI} functions independently in males and females. Although the molecular basis of {CI} remains unknown, proteins with ankyrin ({ANK}) domains represent promising candidates since they might interact with a wide range of host proteins. Here we searched for sequence variability in the 58 {ANK} genes carried in the genomes of Wolbachia variants infecting Culex pipiens. Only five {ANK} genes were polymorphic in the genomes of incompatible Wolbachia variants, and none correlated with the {CI} pattern obtained with 15 mosquito strains (representing 14 Wolbachia variants). Further analysis of {ANK} gene expression evidenced host- and sex-dependent variations, which did not improve the correlation. Taken together, these data do not support the direct implication of {ANK} genes in {CI} determinism.},

	abstract = {The arms race between predators and prey has led to morphological and behavioral adaptations. Different antipredator strategies can coexist within a population if each strategy is the result of a trade-off with competing demands. Antipredator behavior can be associated with morphological traits, like color patterns, either because in the context of sexual selection, coloration signals the ability to avoid predators or because coloration is a naturally selected trait useful in avoiding predators. Because in the barn owl (Tyto alba), heritable eumelanic plumage coloration is associated with the glucocorticoid-dependent response to stress, we tested whether antipredator behavior is also related to this trait. Compared with small-spotted nestlings, individuals displaying larger black spots hissed more intensely in the presence of humans, feigned death longer, had a lower breathing rate under stress, and were more docile when handled. Cross-fostering experiments showed that the covariation between the spot size and the duration of feigning death was inherited from the biological mother, whereas covariation between spot size and docility was inherited from the biological father. Our results confirm that melanin-based coloration is associated with suites of behavioral traits, which are under both genetic and environmental influence. Coloration can thus evolve as a direct or indirect response to predation, but it can also be a signal of antipredator strategies to potential mates.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/4215372},
	abstract = {The numbers, dispersal behavior, aging and residence, and Wrightian neighborhood configurations of three species of Colias butterflies have been studied in central Colorado, using mark-release-recapture techniques as major tools. All populations studied have nonoverlapping generations and mature one brood each year. A brief general review of these species' autecology is given. A system for measuring degree of physical damage to the adults is introduced. This "wear rating" varies with temporal position of any given sample in the course of a brood's flight season, the insects becoming progressively more damaged with time. The sex ratio also changes with brood aging: males eclose before females, and are in the majority early in the flight season, while females may predominate at the end of flight. Local population numbers for the montane grassland species C. alexandra may reach peak levels of 700-900 insects in favorable years, but be much lower in other years as a result of, e.g., drought. Peak densities are no more than 2/ha. The montane bog species, C. scudderi, maintains comparable low density but has much smaller local populations. The subalpine/alpine grassland species C. meadii displays peak local numbers as high as 3000, with peak density as high as 120/hectare. Dispersal varies both among and within species. Those C. alexandra who disperse show an average dispersal radius of about 1.3 km, with a radius for the whole population of about 0.6 km; maximum distance moved was 8 km. Dispersal proportions among recaptures are sharply curtailed by adverse weather, but the dispersal radius of those moving is unaffected by weather. C. scudderi's dispersal is strongly influenced by the geometry of its bog and streamside habitats. Some C. meadii populations approach isolated "island" status, but others show much dispersal. Dispersal radius of those dispersing ranges from 0.3 to 0.7 km in different populations, but the proportion of dispersals varies greatly. The longest observed movement by this species is 1.3 km, although up to 2.6 km could have been detected. Colias normally display constant loss (death plus emigration) rates with average residence expectations of 4-6 days; few insects reach their maximum physiological lifespan of approximately 1 month. Bad weather can increase the loss rate drastically. Females show shorter residence than males, appearently as a result of greater mortality. Total-numbers-per-brood estimates are given for our better studied populations. The reproductive strategy of Colias is such that Wright's models for neighborhood size apply. Neighborhood size for C. alexandra varied sixfold in numbers, and from 3 to 1.3 km in physical extent, between a favorable year and a drought year. One localized C. scudderi habitat is only 200 m in diameter, but a streamside population has a neighborhood length of 4.8 km. In C. meadii, one population of 2000-2500 insects is an 8-ha "island", while another of similar numbers extends a single neighborhood across 1.9 km distance, 450 m altitude, and a major ecological boundary (timberline). Factors such as weather, individuals' visual cueing, and thermoregulatory behavior can influence population structure. For some Colias populations, selection may be very uniform within neighborhoods, while for others, single neighborhoods cross sharp discontinuities in selective forces. These patterns may differ for different selective forces, and may also vary with stages of the insects' life cycle. These populations will now prove a valuable resource for studying evolutionary population genetics.},

We experimentally manipulated the {UV} colour of male pairs, where the members of the pair did not differ significantly in body length, body weight, head size, throat {UV} chroma and brightness or throat blue chroma and brightness measured prior to colour manipulation. By providing these pairs of males to females (only visual stimuli could be perceived by the females), we assessed the role of {UV} in female association preference irrespective of other potentially important visual traits. We found that unmated but receptive females preferred males of higher {UV} reflectance. Our results show for the first time that {UV} colour can be an important male signal in female preference in reptiles.},

	abstract = {It has long been proposed that the nominal species Anastrepha fraterculus is a species complex and earlier studies showed high levels of pre-zygotic isolation between two laboratory strains from Argentina and Peru. Further experiments were carried out on the same populations and on their reciprocal hybrids, including pre- and post-zygotic isolation studies, pheromone analysis, and mitotic and polytene chromosome analysis. A high level of pre-zygotic isolation had been maintained between the parental strains despite 3 years of laboratory rearing under identical conditions. The level of pre-zygotic isolation was reduced in matings with hybrids. There were also differences in other components of mating behaviour. There were quantitative and qualitative differences in the sex pheromone of the two strains with the hybrids producing a mixture. The pre-zygotic isolation barriers were complemented by high levels of post-zygotic inviability and sex ratio distortion, most likely not due to Wolbachia, although there was evidence of some cytoplasmic factor involved in sex ratio distortion. Analysis of polytene chromosomes revealed a high level of asynapsis in the hybrids, together with karyotypic differences between the parental strains. The combined results of the present study indicate that these two strains belong to different biological entities within the proposed A. fraterculus complex.

This is only partly supported by data, as many studies do not find positive associations between ornaments and condition. The reason for this inconsistency remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that environmental context may explain variation in the condition dependence of sexual traits, with stronger relationships between ornaments and condition expected in harsher environments. However, field tests of this idea are scarce. We studied 9 populations of wild red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus over 11 years, and compared the relationship between ornamentation and body mass (an index of body condition) in relation to environmental variability. We used the abundance of a key parasite in this system, Trichostrongylus tenuis, as an index of environmental conditions. We found that both ornament expression and body mass negatively correlated with parasite infection at both population and individual levels. More interestingly, we found that the relationship between ornamentation and body mass was stronger in populations with high parasite infection levels. Our findings support the idea that the condition dependence of secondary sexual ornaments varies in relation to environmental context. In sites and years when parasites are abundant, sexual ornaments provide better signals of condition.},

	abstract = {Reflectance spectrometry, in the avian visible range, is currently a standard methodological approach for plumage colour assessment in birds. However, the method generally employed, whereby only one observation and illumination angle is used, can fail to reveal important colour characteristics. This study shows how the sexual dichromatism of the European Magpie Pica pica can be overlooked by the use of single angle spectrometry, rather than multiple angle spectrometry, and stresses the need to adopt more refined methods for plumage colour assessment. The results of this study may not only have implications in avian colour classification but also in many related fields of biology.},

Unlike humans, most birds perceive {UV} light and several species communicate using the near {UV} spectrum. Indeed, {UV} reflectance in addition to the colour of songbird feathers has been recognized as an important signal when choosing a mate. The king penguin is endowed with several highly coloured ornaments, notably its beak horn and breast and auricular plumage, but only its beak reflects {UV}, a property considered to influence its sexual attraction. Because no avian {UV}-reflecting pigments have yet been identified, the origin of such reflections is probably structural. In an attempt to identify the structures that give rise to {UV} reflectance, we combined reflectance spectrophotometry and morphological analysis by both light and electron microscopy, after experimental removal of surface layers of the beak horn. Here, we characterize for the first time a multilayer reflector photonic microstructure that produces the {UV} reflections in the king penguin beak.},

Currently, the brown bear is limited to Alaska, the Canadian provinces of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Alberta, and six threatened subpopulations in the lower 48 states. To examine the evolutionary history of U. arctos in North America and to assess the genetic divergence between individuals from different geographic regions, we obtained 294 nucleotides of mitochondrial {DNA} sequence data from the control region for 317 free-ranging brown bears. Twenty-eight unique sequences, or mitochondrial {DNA} haplotypes were detected. The average sequence divergence between haplotypes was high (4.3\%), and some haplotypes differed by as many as 23 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony revealed four major mitochondrial {DNA} phylogeographic groups, or clades. The significant phylogeographic structure detected in brown bears strongly contrasts with results obtained for other large carnivores and suggests limited female-mediated gene flow. The mitochondrial {DNA} phylogeographic clades do not correlate with taxonomic classifications for U. arctos, and we hypothesize that the clades were formed prior to migration of this species into North America. We suggest evolutionarily significant units for conservation in three geographic regions: (1) the Alaskan islands of Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof; (2) mainland Alaska, Kodiak Island, and northern Canada; and (3) southern British Columbia, southern Alberta, and the states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

	abstract = {For nearly 80 years, the non-iridescent, blue, integumentary structural colours of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) have been attributed to incoherent Tyndall or Rayleigh scattering. We investigated the production of the integumentary structural colours of a damselfly - the familiar bluet, Enallagma civile (Coenagrionidae) - and a dragonfly - the common green darner, Anax junius (Aeshnidae) - using fibre optic spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}). The reflectance spectra of both species showed discrete reflectance peaks of [{\textasciitilde}]30\% reflectance at 475 and 460 nm, respectively. These structural colours are produced by light scattering from closely packed arrays of spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of box-shaped epidermal pigment cells underlying the cuticle. The observed reflectance spectra do not conform to the inverse fourth power relationship predicted for Tyndall/Rayleigh scattering. Two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of the {TEM} images of the colour-producing arrays reveals ring-shaped distributions of Fourier power at intermediate spatial frequencies, documenting a quasiordered nanostructure. The nanostructured Fourier power spectra falsify the assumption of spatial independence of scatterers that is required for incoherent scattering. Radial averages of the Fourier power spectrum indicate that the spheres are substantially nanostructured at the appropriate spatial scale to produce visible colours by coherent scattering. However, the spatial periodicity of the arrays is apparently too large to produce the observed colour by coherent scattering. The nanospheres could have expanded substantially ([{\textasciitilde}]50\%) during preparation for {TEM}. Alternatively, coherent light scattering could be occurring both from the surfaces and from structures at the centre of the spheres. These arrays of colour-producing spheres within pigment cells have convergently evolved at least 11-14 times independently within the Odonata. Structural colouration from arrays in living cells has also fostered the convergent evolution of temperature-dependent colour change in numerous odonate lineages.},

	abstract = {The compound eye of the butterfly Papilio xuthus consists of three different types of ommatidia, each containing nine photoreceptor cells (R1–R9). We have found previously that the R5–R8 photoreceptors of type {II} ommatidia coexpress two different {mRNAs}, encoding opsins of green- and orange-red-absorbing visual pigments (Kitamoto et al., 1998). Do these cells contain two functionally distinct visual pigments? First, we identified the sensitivity spectrum of these photoreceptors by using combined intracellular recording and dye injection. We thus found that the R5–R8 of type {II} ommatidia have a characteristic sensitivity spectrum extending over an excessively broad spectral range, from the violet to the red region; the photoreceptors are therefore termed broadband photoreceptors. The spectral shape was interpreted with a computational model for type {II} ommatidia, containing a {UV} visual pigment in cells R1 and R2, two green visual pigments in cells R3 and R4, a far-{UV}-absorbing screening pigment (3-hydroxyretinol) in the distal part of the ommatidium, and a red-screening pigment that surrounds the rhabdom. The modeling suggests that both visual pigments in the R5–R8 photoreceptors participate in phototransduction. This work provides the first compelling evidence that multiple visual pigments participate in phototransduction in single invertebrate photoreceptors.},

We used a tetrahedral avian color stimulus space to estimate the avian plumage color gamut from a taxonomically diverse sample of 965 plumage patches from 111 avian species. Our sample represented all known types of plumage coloration mechanisms. The diversity of avian plumage colors occupies only a portion (26-30\%, using violet-sensitive and ultraviolet-sensitive models, respectively) of the total available avian color space, which represents all colors birds can theoretically see and discriminate. For comparison, we also analyzed 2350 plant colors, including an expansive set of flowers. Bird plumages have evolved away from brown bark and green leaf backgrounds and have achieved some striking colors unattainable by flowers. Feather colors form discrete hue "continents,'' leaving vast regions of avian color space unoccupied. We explore several possibilities for these unoccupied hue regions. Some plumage colors may be difficult or impossible to make (constrained by physiological and physical mechanisms), whereas others may be disadvantageous or unattractive (constrained by natural and sexual selection). The plumage gamut of early lineages of living birds was probably small and dominated by melanin-based colors. Over evolutionary time, novel coloration mechanisms allowed plumages to colonize unexplored regions of color space. Pigmentary innovations evolved to broaden the gamut of possible communication signals. Furthermore, the independent origins of structural coloration in many lineages enabled evolutionary expansions into places unreachable by pigmentary mechanisms alone.},

We experimentally supplemented the diet of captive Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua for two months with extracts of krill, a common carotenoid-rich food source for these animals in the wild, to determine whether orange coloration in the beak and feet is influenced by carotenoid content of the diet. We found Using {UV}-Vis reflectance spectrophotometry that dietary carotenoid enrichment elevated beak but not foot brightness. This suggests that the crustacean part of the diet is at least in part responsible for orange beak coloration but not feet in Gentoo Penguins and that, like other carotenoid signals, these traits have the potential to reveal important aspects of mate quality (e.g., nutrition, health).},

The earliest known microfossils (similar to 3,500 Myr before present) are structurally complex, and if it is assumed that the associated organisms required a long time to develop this degree of complexity, then the existence of life much earlier than this can be argued(1,2). But the known examples of crustal rocks older than similar to 3,500 Myr have experienced intense metamorphism, which would have obliterated any fragile microfossils contained therein. It is therefore necessary to search for geochemical evidence of past biotic activity that has been preserved within minerals that are resistant to metamorphism. Here we report ion-microprobe measurements of the carbon-isotope composition of carbonaceous inclusions within grains of apatite (basic calcium phosphate) from the oldest known sediment sequences-a similar to 3,800-Myr-old banded iron formation from the Isua supracrustal belt, West Greenland(35), and a similar formation from the nearby Akilia island that is possibly older than 3,850 Myr (ref, 3). The carbon in the carbonaceous inclusions is isotopically light, indicative of biological activity; no known abiotic process can explain the data. Unless some unknown abiotic process exists which is able both to create such isotopically light carbon and then selectively incorporate it into apatite grains, our results provide evidence for the emergence of life on Earth by at least 3,800 Myr before present.},

Multiple studies, however, have revealed the importance of non-pollinating visitors in floral evolution. Using the polymorphic annual daisy Ursinia calenduliflora, this study investigated the importance of different insect visitors, and their effects on fitness, in the maintenance of floral polymorphism.Methods The spatial structure of a discrete floral polymorphism was characterized based on the presence/absence of anthocyanin floret spots in U. calenduliflora. A 3-year observational study was then conducted in polymorphic populations to investigate differences in visitation rates of dominant visitors to floral morphs. Experiments were performed to explore the floral preference of male and female Megapalpus capensis (the dominant insect visitor) and their effectiveness as pollinators. Next, floral damage by antagonistic florivores and the reproductive success of the two floral morphs were surveyed in multiple populations and years.Key Results Floral polymorphism in U. calenduliflora was structured spatially, as were insect visitation patterns. Megapalpus capensis males were the dominant visitors and exhibited strong preference for the spotted morph in natural and experimental observations. While this may indicate potential fitness benefits for the spotted morph, female fitness did not differ between floral morphs. However, as M. capensis males are very efficient at exporting U. calenduliflora pollen, their preference may likely increase the reproductive fitness of the spotted morph through male fitness components. The spotted morph, however, also suffered significantly greater costs due to ovule predation by florivores than the spotless morph.Conclusions The results suggest that pollinators and florivores may potentially exert antagonistic selection that could contribute to the maintenance of floral polymorphism across the range of U. calenduliflora. The relative strength of selection imposed by each agent is potentially determined by insect community composition and abundance at each site, highlighting the importance of community context in the evolution of floral phenotypes.},

	abstract = {In many animals, conspicuous coloration functions as a quality signal. Indicator models predict that such colors should be variable and condition dependent. In Habronattus pyrrithrix jumping spiders, females are inconspicuously colored, while males display brilliant red faces, green legs, and white pedipalps during courtship. We tested the predictions of the indicator model in a field study and found that male body condition was positively correlated with the size, hue, and red chroma of a male's facial patch and negatively correlated with the brightness of his green legs. These traits were more condition dependent than non-display colors. We then tested a dietary mechanism for condition dependence using two experiments. To understand how juvenile diet affects the development of coloration, we reared juvenile spiders on high- and low-quality diets and measured coloration at maturity. To understand how adult diet affects the maintenance of coloration, we fed wild-caught adults with high- or low-quality diets and compared their coloration after 45 days. In the first experiment, males fed high-quality diet had redder faces, suggesting that condition dependence is mediated by juvenile diet. In the second experiment, red coloration did not differ between treatments, suggesting that adult diet is not important for maintaining the color after it is produced at maturity. Diet had no effect on green coloration in either experiment. Our results show different degrees of condition dependence for male display colors. Because red is dependent on juvenile diet, it may signal health or foraging ability. We discuss evidence that green coloration is age dependent and alternatives to indicator models for colorful displays in jumping spiders.},

	abstract = {Recent studies proposed that the colouration of diurnal orbweaving spiders can attract hymenopteran prey. The main assumption behind the prey-attraction hypothesis is that orbweavers might lure pollinators by mimicking floral images. However, the visual appearance of spiders hunting in webs seems to mimic foliage, soil or a dead leaf. Here, we performed a field experiment with artificial webs to test the hypothesis that the appearance of diurnal orbweavers serves to attract pollinating insects. We predicted that if the presence of diurnal spiders attracts prey, the nets containing diurnal Argiope bruennichi should intercept more prey than both empty nets and the nets with nocturnal Larinioides cornutus. Alternatively, if diurnal spiders are cryptic to diurnal prey, Argiope nets should collect more prey than Larinioides nets, but Argiope's capture success should be similar to that of empty nets. We found that Argiope webs collected more insects than Larinioides webs, yet their capture success was comparable to that of the nets containing no spider. Also, Argiope showed less saturated colouration than Larinioides. Our work supports the hypothesis that the physical appearance of diurnal orbweavers might have evolved to camouflage them in their hunting habitat.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that structural plumage coloration can indicate male quality and is used in female mate choice decisions. Whether or not structural coloration functions as a signal in male-male competitive interactions, however, has not been studied. Male eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, have brilliant ultraviolet-blue plumage on the head, back, wings and tail that is correlated with both reproductive effort and reproductive success. Bluebirds cannot excavate their own nest cavities, and as a consequence of limited nest sites, often engage in intense competition for nestboxes. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that structural coloration reflects male competitive ability by manipulating the number of available nestboxes. We erected a limited number of nestboxes in early spring and, after birds has established residency in those nestboxes, we added more nestboxes to the study site. We found that the reflective properties of the ultraviolet-blue plumage differed between males that acquired nestboxes early versus late in the spring, indicating that more colourful birds won competitions for access to nest sites. We also found that more colourful males fledged more offspring. These observations support the hypothesis that structural plumage colour is a condition-dependent trait in male eastern bluebirds that could be used to accurately assess the fighting ability of competitors.

	abstract = {Many cnidarians exist in an obligatory mutualism with dinoflagellates commonly called zooxanthellae. When these symbioses are stressed, zooxanthella densities often decrease (i.e., bleaching), resulting in reduced host fitness or mortality. Because zooxanthellae play a prominent role in the coloration of hosts, several analyses of reflected spectra from photographic images have been developed to quantify zooxanthella densities and serve as a proxy for invasive sampling methods. To date these techniques have not been compared. In this study, global information system ({GIS}) tools, commonly used with aerial and satellite images, and photographs of healthy and bleached sea anemones, Aiptasia pallida (Verrill), were used to compare these image analysis methods. Zooxanthella densities and chlorophyll-a concentrations were correlated with image brightness (i.e., digital number) in: the red, green, and blue bands ({RGB}); the average of the three {RGB} bands ({RGB}/3); intensity and saturation bands ({IHS}); and using a principal components analysis ({PCA}) of the {RGB} bands. {RGB} brightness correlations with zooxanthella densities and chlorophyll-a concentrations were highest using the blue band, followed by green, then red. Using any one band within {RGB}, however, restricts comparisons to similar color morphs. {RGB}/3, {IHS} or {PCA} transformations enable intra and inter-specific comparisons where colors may vary. Among these transformations, {PCA} and intensity had higher correlations, followed by {RGB}/3, then saturation. {RGB}/3 and {IHS}, unlike {PCA}, ignore the correlations between the three {RGB} bands, treating each pixel independently. {PCA} uses these correlations, and in doing so lessens the effects of heteroscedasticity in. the data. In addition, the observed reciprocal relationship of intensity and saturation may serve as a standardized criterion for bleaching. Finally, this study demonstrates that {GIS} has broad interdisciplinary applications for spatial and spectral analyses from the individual colony to reef scale assessments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, northern male Pied Flycatchers become darker with age, a trend not detected until the present study in southern birds. Here we show that in an Iberian population of Pied Flycatchers breeding only a few tens of kilometres from previously studied populations, plumage darkness is associated with mating success and increases with age, whereas the size of the white forehead patch is not related to mating success and is only weakly correlated with age, trends similar to those reported for Scandinavian rather than other Iberian Pied Flycatcher populations. This represents a case of variation in sexually selected traits between geographically close populations of Pied Flycatchers that cannot be explained by sympatry with closely related species. It is proposed that differences in the identity and abundance of environmental stressors may be the cause of this regional variation in sexually selected traits.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that blue-green coloration of bird eggshells may be related to female and/or egg phenotypic quality, and that such colour may affect parental effort and therefore the nutritional environment of developing nestlings. Here we suggest that these relationships and the signal function of eggshell coloration would affect the outcome of coevolution between avian brood parasites and their hosts in at least three different non-exclusive evolutionary pathways. First, by laying blue-green coloured eggs, cuckoo females may exploit possible sensory biases of their hosts, constraining the evolution of parasitic egg recognition, and thus avoid rejection. Second, because of the relatively high costs of laying blue eggs, cuckoo females may be limited in their ability to mimic costly blue-green eggs of their hosts because cuckoo females lay many more eggs than their hosts. Furthermore, costs associated with foreign egg recognition errors would be relatively higher for hosts laying blue eggs. Third, cuckoos may use coloration of host eggs for selecting individuals or specific hosts of appropriate phenotypic quality (i.e. parental abilities). We here explored some predictions emerging from the above scenarios and found partial support for two of them by studying egg coloration of European cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and that of their 25 main hosts, as well as parasitism and rejection rate of hosts. Cuckoo hosts parasitized with more blue, green, and ultraviolet cuckoo eggs, or those laying more blue-green eggs, were more prone to accept experimental parasitism with artificial cuckoo eggs. In addition, coloration of cuckoo eggs is more variable when parasitizing hosts laying bluer-greener eggs, even after controlling for the effect of host egg coloration (i.e. degree of egg matching). Globally, our results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that host egg traits that are related to phenotypic quality of hosts, such as egg coloration, may have important implications for the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and brood parasites.

Here, we show that for eight previously untrained dogs colour proved to be more informative than brightness when choosing between visual stimuli differing both in brightness and chromaticity. Although brightness could have been used by the dogs in our experiments (unlike previous studies), it was not. Our results demonstrate that under natural photopic lighting conditions colour information may be predominant even for animals that possess only two spectral types of cone photoreceptors.},

Because of the proposed physiological costs associated with deposition of biliverdin pigments and because of their conspicuousness, eggs with blue-green coloration may reliably convey information about female or brood quality. We tested the hypothesis that expression of blue-green coloration of eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) eggs positively correlates to female condition. First, we documented the incidence of egg color polymorphism within the population. We observed that 98\% of females laid blue-green eggs while less than 2\% laid white eggs and less than 1\% laid pink eggs. In a subset of clutches, we used full spectrum reflectance spectrometry (300-700 nm) to compare eggshell coloration to measures of female condition. We found that the color of eggs within clutches was more similar than the color of eggs from different clutches, and that the blue-green eggs have spectral peaks that are consistent with the characteristic absorbance spectra of biliverdin pigmentation. Females in better body condition and older females laid more colorful eggs. Moreover, individual females laid more colorful eggs later in the laying sequence. Overall, these data indicate that egg coloration covaries with female condition, suggesting that egg coloration could function as a reliable signal of female quality or that egg coloration may allow females to recognize eggs laid by conspecific brood parasites.},

We noted the calcium deposition in eggshells, egg measurements, light conditions in nests and starling eye properties. Egg colouration shows high within-clutch similarity. Intensity of the blue-green egg colour neither depends on Ca deposition in the eggshell nor correlates with egg measurements, clutch size and laying date. This suggests that the intensity of the blue-green colour of starling eggs does not reflect female condition, which is reported to affect egg and clutch parameters. Low light intensity in cavities enables only mesopic vision, which is characterised by degraded visual acuity and colour sense, as well as Purkinje shift. As a consequence, the probability of precise assessment of the differences in eggs colour by starling males, crucial for the signalling hypothesis (Moreno Osorno 2003), is not high. On the other hand, irrespective of its intensity, blue-green is the last colour visible under decreased illumination. Thus such coloured eggs may attract higher parental attention in dark cavities. We also demonstrated a strong negative correlation between intensity of blue-green and {UV} colouration of starling eggs, as well as constrained sensitivity of the starling eye to the range of eggs' maximum {UV} reflectance. Our study indicates that it is blue-green, not the {UV} component of the egg's spectral characteristics, which seems to increase the perception of eggs by adults in dark cavities. We suggest that it might have been the most important pressure towards evolution of blue-green colouration of eggs in cavity-nesting birds.},

In a previous study of Japanese populations of Tetranychus urticae, two out of three green-form populations tested were infected with non-{CI} Wolbachia strains, whereas none of six red-form populations harbored Wolbachia. As the survey of Wolbachia infection in T. urticae is still fragmentary in Japan, we checked Wolbachia infection in thirty green-form populations and 29 red-form populations collected from a wide range of Japanese islands. For Wolbachia-infected populations, we tested the effects of Wolbachia on the reproductive traits and determined the phylogenetic relationships of the different strains of Wolbachia. All but one green-form populations were infected with Wolbachia and all strains belonged to the subgroup Ori when the wsp gene was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of different strains of Wolbachia. Six out of 29 red-form populations harbored Wolbachia and the infected strains belonged to the subgroups Ori and Bugs. Twenty-four of 29 infected green-form populations and five of six infected red-form populations induced {CI} among the hosts. Thus, {CI}-Wolbachia strains are widespread in Japan, and no geographical trend was observed in the {CI}-Wolbachia.

	abstract = {Natural selection shapes the evolution of anti-predator defences, such as camouflage. It is currently contentious whether crypsis and disruptive coloration are alternative mechanisms of camouflage or whether they are interrelated anti-predator defences. Disruptively coloured prey is characterized by highly contrasting patterns to conceal the body shape, whereas cryptic prey minimizes the contrasts to background. Determining bird predation of artificial moths, we found that moths which were dissimilar from the background but sported disruptive patterns on the edge of their wings survived better in heterogeneous habitats than did moths with the same patterns inside of the wings and better than cryptic moths. Despite lower contrasts to background, crypsis did not provide fitness benefits over disruptive coloration on the body outline. We conclude that disruptive coloration on the edge camouflages its bearer independent of background matching. We suggest that this result is explainable because disruptive coloration is effective by exploiting predators' cognitive mechanisms of prey recognition and not their sensory mechanisms of signal detection. Relative to disruptive patterns on the body outline, disruptive markings on the body interior are less effective. Camouflage owing to disruptive coloration on the body interior is background-specific and is as effective as crypsis in heterogeneous habitats. Hence, we hypothesize that two proximate mechanisms explain the diversity of visual anti-predator defences. First, disruptive coloration on the body outline provides camouflage independent of the background. Second, background matching and disruptive coloration on the body interior provide camouflage, but their protection is background-specific.},

	abstract = {Many species have elaborate and complex coloration and patterning, which often differ between the sexes. Sexual selection may increase the size or intensity of color patches (elaboration) in one sex or drive the evolution of novel signal elements (innovation). The latter potentially increases color pattern complexity. Color pattern complexity may also be influenced by ecological factors related to predation and environment; however, very few studies have investigated the effects of both sexual and natural selection on color pattern complexity across species. We used a phylogenetic comparative approach to examine these effects in 85 species and subspecies of Australian dragon lizards (family Agamidae). We quantified color pattern complexity by adapting the {ShannonWiener} diversity index. There were clear sex differences in color pattern complexity, which were positively correlated with both sexual dichromatism and sexual size dimorphism, consistent with the idea that sexual selection plays a significant role in the evolution of color pattern complexity. By contrast, we found little evidence of a link between environmental factors and color pattern complexity on body regions exposed to predators. Our results suggest that sexual selection rather than natural selection has led to increased color pattern complexity in males.},

	abstract = {Assessments of restoration are usually made through vegetation community surveys, leaving much of the ecosystem underexamined. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are good candidates for restoration evaluation because they are sensitive to environmental change and are particularly important in ecosystem functioning. The considerable resources currently employed in restoring calcareous grassland on ex-arable land mean that it is important to gather as much information as possible on how ecosystems change through restoration. We compared ant communities from 40 ex-arable sites where some form of restoration work had been implemented between 2 and 60 years previously, with 40 paired reference sites of good quality calcareous grassland with no history of improvement or cultivation. A total of 11 ant species were found, but only two of these were found to be significantly different in abundance between restoration and reference sites: Myrmica sabuleti was more likely to be present in reference sites, whereas Lasius niger was more likely to be found in restoration sites. Myrmica sabuleti abundance was significantly positively correlated with age of restoration sites. The potential number of ant species found in temperate grasslands is small, limiting the information their assemblages can provide about ecosystem change. However, M. sabuleti is a good indicator species for calcareous grassland restoration success and, alongside information from the plant community, could increase the confidence with which restoration success is judged. We found the survey to be quick and simple to carry out and recommend its use.},

Other tetranychid mites possess supergroup B Wolbachia strains. The discovery of another Wolbachia supergroup expands the known diversity of Wolbachia and emphasizes the high variability of the genus. Our data also clarify the existing supergroup structure and highlight the use of multiple gene sequences for robust phylogenetic analysis. In addition to previous reports of recombination between the arthropod-infecting supergroups A and B, we provide evidence for recombination between the nematode-infecting supergroups C and D. Robust delineation of supergroups is essential for understanding the origin and spread of this common reproductive parasite and for unraveling mechanisms of host adaptation and manipulation across a wide range of hosts.},

In the course of further analyzing their foraging behavior in a laboratory condition, we found that some butterflies could not land on the target flower even they discriminated and tried to land on it, especially when the target was dark. This phenomenon, which we call "landing suppression", indicates that the cue for landing differs from the cue for visually locating a flower. We hypothesized that a possible cue for landing was intensity contrast between the target and background, and have initiated to test this hypothesis. We tested the butterflies' landing behavior to targets of various colors and intensities presented on background of black or various densities of gray. As a result, the landing was most strongly suppressed when the intensity contrast was close to zero irrespective of the target colors, suggesting that the butterflies used the target-background intensity contrast when landing.},

Fleshy-fruits are often conspicuously coloured to signal different types of information including fruit maturity and spatial location. Previous work on fruit colour selection focus on large diurnal vertebrates, yet fruit colours are perceived differently by frugivores with different types of visual systems. Here, we tested whether a nocturnal, frugivorous, seed-dispersing insect selects fruits based on their pigmentation and whether different lighting conditions affect fruit colour selection. We captured 20 Wellington tree weta (Hemideina crassidens) from a forest reserve on the North Island of New Zealand and brought them into laboratory conditions to test their fruit colour preferences. The fruits of Coprosma acerosa, a native shrub species that naturally produces translucent, blue-streaked fruits, were dyed either red or blue. Fruits were then offered to weta in a binary (y-maze) choice test in two light conditions, either at night during a full moon or under artificial light conditions in the lab. Weta preferred unmanipulated, naturally blue-streaked fruits and artificially-blue coloured fruits over those dyed red. Furthermore, their colour preferences were unaffected by light environment. Our results therefore suggest that weta can discriminate between colours (using colour vision) in both light and dark light environments. Their consistent preferences for colours other than red indicate that weta might be responsible for the unusual colours of fleshy-fruits in New Zealand.},

	abstract = {By having phenotypically plastic traits, many organisms optimize their fitness in response to fluctuating threats. Freshwater snails with translucent shells, e.g. snails from the Radix genus, differ considerably in their mantle pigmentation patterns, with snails from the same water body ranging from being completely dark pigmented to having only a few dark patterns. These pigmentation differences have previously been suggested to be genetically fixed, but we propose that this polymorphism is owing to phenotypic plasticity in response to a fluctuating environment. Hence, we here aimed to assess whether common stressors, including ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) and predation, induce a plastic response in mantle pigmentation patterns of Radix balthica. We show, in contrast to previous studies, that snails are plastic in their expression of mantle pigmentation in response to changes in {UVR} and predator threats, i.e. differences among populations are not genetically fixed. When exposed to cues from visually hunting fish, R. balthica increased the proportion of their dark pigmentation, suggesting a crypsis strategy. Snails increased their pigmentation even further in response to {UVR}, but this also led to a reduction in pattern complexity. Furthermore, when exposed to {UVR} and fish simultaneously, snails responded in the same way as in the {UVR} treatment, suggesting a trade-off between photoprotection and crypsis.},

Condition-dependent expression of ornamental traits is a fundamental assumption of theories on the honesty of sexual signals, and it is widely assumed that condition-dependence is a signature feature of ornaments. 2. Some of the best understood condition-dependent traits are the striking carotenoid-based plumage signals of male birds, yet little is known about the many less conspicuous, less elaborate carotenoid-based plumage colours that often comprise large parts of the plumage. 3. We examined colour (reflectance) of carotenoid-based plumage in male greenfinches that were provided with naturalistic diets with relatively low and with enhanced lutein availability during their annual moult. Using a variety of objective colorimetrics, including physiological models of avian colour vision, we compared experimental effects and general condition-dependence on the contrasting bright yellow tail patch, the yellow-green breast as well as three duller, yellow- to olive-green patches (back, crown, rump). 4. Irrespective of the analysis method used, we found consistent and large diet effects on the reflectance of the tail, much weaker effects on the reflectance of the breast, and no significant effects on the other three plumage parts. Likewise, we found that only the colour of the tail was strongly associated with circulating (plasma) lutein concentration, as well as with general condition (body mass, haematocrit). 5. Our results suggest that, in accord with current theories on the signal honesty, the striking yellow tail patch of the male greenfinch appears to be particularly well-adapted to signal information on carotenoid availability and general condition of the male during moult.},

These multiple signals may convey different messages if they are intended for different receivers (e. g., male or females) that have different interests. We examined the functions of multiple colorful visual traits of male Schreiber's green lizard (Lacerta schreiberi). Results showed that interindividual variation in the characteristics of coloration of males can be related to variation in morphology, health state, dominance status, and pairing status, but that different relationships were found for each color signal. For example, dominant males had brighter "blue" throat and with higher values of ultraviolet ({UV}) and bluish coloration and darker and greenish dorsal coloration than subordinate males. Health state was also reflected in coloration; males with a higher immune response had "blue" throats with lower amounts of {UV} coloration, but had "yellow" chests with higher amounts of {UV} coloration. Males found guarding females also differed in coloration from males found alone. These data suggest that characteristics of coloration of the different multiple signals may reveal different messages for different receivers, either male or female conspecifics. The development of the different signals, based on different morphological and physiological mechanisms and trade-offs, may allow signal reliability of multiple colorful traits in different social contexts.},

Studies have shown that birds often pay attention to some parts of a signalling pattern and disregard others, which could be of importance in Batesian mimicry, where a palatable species copies the visual appearance of a distasteful model in order to deceive predators. We used domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, and artificial prey signals to investigate whether predators use different warning colour components for discrimination depending on the degree of information about prey quality they convey. This study supports earlier findings of the importance of colour for discrimination among prey but also provides evidence that other less associable signal properties such as internal patterning, when holding valuable discriminatory information, can be used to assess prey quality in a hierarchical manner. The results also suggest that, in certain circumstances, the presence of a palatable mimic can have positive effects on learning, resulting in 'super-Mullerian' effects. We propose that the degree of selection for perfect mimicry may be dependent on the proportion of well-educated predators in the population.

Here we studied colour variation and potential signalling of the yellow bill a trait functioning as sexual signal in diurnal raptors during the breeding season in females of a truly nocturnal raptor, the little owl Athene noctua. We found that yellow-red chroma of the bill was highly variable between individuals and positively correlated with female fitness prospects (i.e. brood size at fledging). In addition, we found that females with brighter bills were larger in size and produced owlets with a higher mass at fledging. This study suggests that yellow bill colouration in female little owls may potentially play a role in sexual signalling and may constitute the first evidence of chromatic colour signalling in a nocturnal bird.},

The about 4,000 species worldwide engage in highly interesting and complex relationships with their microbial fauna. One of the key symbionts in arthropods is Wolbachia, an alpha-Proteobacterium implicated in many important biological processes and believed to be a potential tool for biological control. Aphids were thought not to harbour Wolbachia; however, current data suggest that its presence in aphids has been missed, probably due to the low titre of the infection and/or to the high divergence of the Wolbachia strains of aphids. The goal of the present study is to map the Wolbachia infection status of natural aphids populations, along with the characterization of the detected Wolbachia strains. Out of 425 samples from Spain, Portugal, Greece, Israel and Iran, 37 were found to be infected. Our results, based mainly on 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing, indicate the presence of two new Wolbachia supergroups prevailing in aphids, along with some strains belonging either to supergroup B or to supergroup A.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that infect a large number of insects and are responsible for different reproductive alterations of their hosts. One of the key features of Wolbachia biology is its ability to move within and between host species, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts. Using multiple Wolbachia genes, including five developed for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing ({MLST}), the diversity and modes of movement of Wolbachia within the wasp genus Nasonia were investigated. Eleven different Wolbachia were found in the four species of Nasonia, including five newly identified infections. Five infections were acquired by horizontal transmission from other insect taxa, three have been acquired by hybridization between two Nasonia species, which resulted in a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep from one species to the other, and at least three have codiverged during speciation of their hosts. The results show that a variety of transfer mechanisms of Wolbachia are possible even within a single host genus. Codivergence of Wolbachia and their hosts is uncommon and provides a rare opportunity to investigate long-term Wolbachia evolution within a host lineage. Using synonymous divergence among codiverging infections and host nuclear genes, we estimate Wolbachia mutation rates to be approximately one-third that of the nuclear genome.},

	abstract = {The study of sexual dichromatism has played an important role in the development and testing of evolutionary theory. However, previous work has often relied on human vision to assess plumage color and contrast, an approach challenged by the finding that dichromatism is often visible to birds but invisible to humans. We explicitly tested whether the use of human vision undermines previous comparative analyses in antbirds (Thamnophilidae). Focusing on a sample of 71 species, we used (1) molecular sequencing of the {SWS}1 opsin gene to assess spectral sensitivity and (2) spectrophotometry and color discrimination models to compare human and avian perception of dichromatism. We show that antbirds, like the majority of avian families studied to date, are violet-sensitive ({VS}) rather than ultraviolet-sensitive ({UVS}). We also demonstrate that species perceived as monochromatic by humans may look dichromatic to antbirds, but that human and avian perceptions of dichromatism are nonetheless positively correlated. To assess whether this relationship validates the assumptions of published comparative analyses, we re-ran the analyses using avian-perceived dichromatism; the results remained qualitatively unchanged. Although it is clear that the use of spectrophotometry and visual models can improve measurements of plumage coloration, we conclude that scores generated from human perception provide a meaningful estimate of sexual dichromatism for the purposes of comparative analyses, at least in antbirds. Furthermore, our results suggest that discrepancies between human and avian perceptions of sexual color differences may be relatively minor in avian families with {VS} visual systems.

However, most intraspecific visual signals are also conspicuous to predators, so that signalling can lead to the serious consequence of predation. Could an animal achieve visual camouflage and simultaneously send a hidden visual message to a conspecific? Here, we present evidence that the polarized aspect of iridescent colour in squid skin is maintained after it passes through the overlying pigmented chromatophores, which produce the highly evolved—and dynamically changeable—camouflaged patterns in cephalopods. Since cephalopods are polarization sensitive, and can regulate polarization via skin iridescence, it is conceivable that they could send polarized signals to conspecifics while staying camouflaged to fish or mammalian predators, most of which are not polarization sensitive.},

The spectral properties of carotenoid and structurally-based plumage colors and the patch sizes of melanin-based plumage colors have received considerable attention as sexual signals in birds. However, the importance of variation in achromatic plumage colors (white, gray and black) remains virtually unexplored, despite their widespread occurrence. We investigated a potential signal function of the achromatic black and white plumage of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla). We captured and color-banded 178 free-living chickadees and assessed winter flock dominance hierarchies by tabulating pairwise interactions at feeders. We recaptured 73 of these birds and measured plumage coloration for six body regions using a reflectance spectrometer and the area of melanin-based plumage patches from standardized photographs. We found extensive individual variation in chickadee plumage traits and considerable sexual dichromatism. Male black-capped chickadees have significantly brighter white plumage than females, larger black patches, and greater plumage contrast between adjacent white and black plumage regions. We also found rank differences in the plumage reflectance of males; high-ranking males, who are preferred by females as both social and extra-pair partners, exhibit significantly darker black plumage and grow their feathers more rapidly than low-ranking males. This variation among individuals reveals a potential signal function for achromatic plumage coloration in birds.},

	abstract = {Crypsis results from a complex interaction among prey coloration, background matching, behaviour and predator visual perception. Tadpoles are known to have varied adaptations to escape predation, but the use of crypsis is little explored, although it is likely for certain species. We investigated potential escape mechanisms related to active escape ( fleeing) and crypsis improvement in Bokermannohyla alvarengai tadpoles, proposing a new method to measure cryptic potential. We studied the range of distances covered by threatened and fleeing tadpoles and the proportion of tadpoles that seek shelter or remain exposed after fleeing. We hypothesized that tadpoles that remain exposed may use alternative strategies to avoid detection, such as reaching deeper microhabitats or positioning themselves on substrates that confer greater crypsis than the ones they were on before disturbance. A significantly greater proportion of tadpoles remained exposed after disturbance and positioned themselves on backgrounds that offered greater cryptic potential, but did not differ in depth. Tadpoles may respond to a trade-off between sheltering and being cryptic. On the one hand, they may remain close to retreat sites or they may escape to microhabitats that provide appropriate background matching as a means to achieve crypsis. On the other hand, the absence of matching backgrounds in the tadpoles' vicinities may induce them to seek shelter.

Based on more than 27,600 individual choices made by several birds at 10 wavelengths, the photopic sensitivity (i.e., color thresholds) of these birds is found to be consistent with the hypothesis that threshold discrimination of colored targets is limited by receptor noise And that high sensitivity to near-ultraviolet wavelengths is in harmony with the relatively small number of ultraviolet cones present in the retina. The pronounced fine structure of the sensitivity spectrum is caused by the absorption of cone oil droplets. Under natural sunlight, containing more energy in the near-ultraviolet than is present in artificial indoor lighting, the birds' peak of sensitivity in the ultraviolet should be much less prominent than it is in laboratory experiments.},

In the second study, it was demonstrated that faithful mimicry of Papilio palinurus can be achieved by physical fabrication methods through using breath figures to provide templates and {ALD} routines to enable optical properties. Finally, knowledge of the optical structure properties of the Princeps nireus butterfly has resulted in bioinspired designs to enhanced scintillator designs for radiation detection.},

By scoring phenotypes and wing expression of five genes in 399 and 21 nymphalid species, respectively, we tested when eyespots and expression of their associated genes evolved. We found that the origin of eyespots was concurrent with the origin of the gene expression patterns, approximately 90 million years ago. Following this event, many genes expressed in eyespot development were lost in some lineages without a corresponding loss of eyespots, indicating substantial evolution in the cluster of genes associated with eyespots. This finding suggests that complex traits such as butterfly eyespots may initially evolve by re-deploying pre-existing gene regulatory networks, which are subsequently trimmed of genes that are unnecessary in the novel context.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Discrimination was possible whenever shapes presented contrast to the long wavelength receptor but was independent of chromatic contrast, overall intensity contrast or short and middle wavelength receptor contrast. We suggest that the bees used the edges of the closed shapes to solve the task. Bees failed when shapes were rotated, showing that a single shape edge was not sufficient for recognition.

Maintaining spatial color-pattern polymorphism requires local pattern avoidance, fine-scale discrimination among similar wing patterns, and repeated attacks on novel color patterns. I tested for these behaviors by presenting 80 adult rufous-tailed jacamars (Galbula ruficauda) with three morphs of Heliconius butterflies, and then presenting the same suite of butterflies to 46 of these jacamars between four and 429 days later. These trials offer the first direct evidence of the selective predator behavior required to maintain aposematic polymorphism: jacamars avoid local aposematic morphs while repeatedly attacking similar but novel morphs over time.},

They are also polymorphic in bib colour; some males have a bright yellow area under the chin, while others lack this coloured area entirely. We show that red males with a bib are in better body condition than red males that lack a bib. This contrasts sharply to yellow males, in which males with a bib are in poorer condition than yellow males that lack a bib. Our analysis also shows that following exposure to a high percentage of red (more aggressive) neighbours, all males suffer a reduction in body condition, and importantly, males with a bib (regardless of their head colour) suffer a more severe loss of body condition than males that lack a bib. Finally, this condition loss is significantly higher for yellow bibbed males than for red bibbed males, suggesting that the cost of sporting a bib may be higher for them. Orange males showed a non-significant difference in condition between bib morphs. Our analysis also shows that bibbed yellow males (the morph with lower body condition), but no other morph category, declined significantly in their frequency between 2 years.},

Mature foodplants of S. nodiflora, Sida rhombifolia (L.), Sida acuta (Burm. f) and Malvastrum coromandelianum (L.)

Females were present at the site from 0900 to 1500 hours, and were more persistent than their male counterparts under adverse environmental conditions (i.e, reduced temperature and solar radiation). The relatively high number and apparent selectiveness of ovipositing females in this situation indicates the importance placed on utilising fresh growth of the larval foodplant. This behaviour may serve to maximise the rate of return per unit reproductive effort of post-diapause females.},

The mechanisms hairworms use to increase the encounter rate between their host and water remain, however, poorly understood. Considering the selective landscape in which nematomorph manipulation has evolved as well as previously obtained proteomics data, we predicted that crickets harboring mature hairworms would display a modified behavioral response to light. Since following parasite emergence in water, the cricket host and parasitic worm do not interact physiologically anymore, we also predicted that the host would recover from the modified behaviors. We examined the effect of hairworm infection on different behavioral responses of the host when stimulated by light to record responses from uninfected, infected, and ex-infected crickets. We showed that hairworm infection fundamentally modifies cricket behavior by inducing directed responses to light, a condition from which they mostly recover once the parasite is released. This study supports the idea that host manipulation by parasites is subtle, complex, and multidimensional.},

	abstract = {Abstract Mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) sequences were used to evaluate phylogeographic structure within and among populations of three endangered Hawaiian tree snail species (n = 86). The primary focus of this investigation was on setting conservation priorities for Achatinella mustelina . Limited data sets for two additional endangered Hawaiian tree snails, A. livida and A. sowerbyana, were also developed for comparative purposes. Pairwise genetic distance matrices and phylogenetic trees were generated, and an analysis of molecular variance was performed on 675-base pair cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences from multiple populations of Hawaiian tree snails. Sequence data were analysed under distance-based maximum-likelihood, and maximum-parsimony optimality criteria. Within the focal species, A. mustelina , numbers of variable and parsimony informative sites were 90 and 69, respectively. Pairwise intraspecific {mtDNA} sequence divergence ranged from 0 to 5.3\% in A. mustelina , from 0 to 1.0\% in A. livida and from 0 to 1.9\% in A. sowerbyana . For A. mustelina , population genetic structure and mountain topography were strongly correlated. Maximum genetic distances were observed across deep, largely deforested valleys, and steep mountain peaks, independent of geographical distance. However, in certain areas where forest cover is presently fragmented, little {mtDNA} sequence divergence exists despite large geographical scales (8 km). Genetic data were used to define evolutionarily significant units for conservation purposes including decisions regarding placement of predator exclusion fences, captive propagation, re-introduction and translocation.

	abstract = {A suite of seagrass indicator metrics is developed to evaluate four essential measures of seagrass community status for Florida Bay. The measures are based on several years of monitoring data using the Braun-Blanquet Cover Abundance ({BBCA}) scale to derive information about seagrass spatial extent, abundance, species diversity and presence of target species. As ecosystem restoration proceeds in south Florida, additional freshwater will be discharged to Florida Bay as a means to restore the bay's hydrology and salinity regime. Primary hypotheses about restoring ecological function of the keystone seagrass community are based on the premise that hydrologic restoration will increase environmental variability and reduce hypersalinity. This will create greater niche space and permit multiple seagrass species to coexist while maintaining good environmental conditions for Thalassia testudinum, the dominant climax seagrass species. Greater species diversity is considered beneficial to habitat for desired higher trophic level species such as forage fish and shrimp. it is also important to maintenance of a viable seagrass community that will avoid die-off events observed in the past. Indicator metrics are assigned values at the basin spatial scale and are aggregated to five larger zones. Three index metrics are derived by combining the four indicators through logic gates at the zone spatial scale and aggregated to derive a single bay-wide system status score standardized on the System-wide Indicator protocol. The indicators will provide a way to assess progress toward restoration goals or reveal areas of concern. Reporting for each indicator, index and overall system status score is presented in a red-yellow-green format that summarizes information in a readily accessible form for mangers, policy-makers and stakeholders in planning and implementing an adaptive management strategy.

	abstract = {The field of study that deals with the origins of life does not have a consensus for a theory of life's origin. An analysis of the range of theories offered shows that they share some common features that may be reliable predictors when considering the possible origins of life on another planet. The fundamental datum dealing with the origins of life is that life appeared early in the history of the Earth, probably before 3.5 Ga and possibly before 3.8 Ga. What might be called the standard theory (the Oparin-Haldane theory) posits the production of organic molecules on the early Earth followed by chemical reactions that produced increased organic complexity leading eventually to organic life capable of reproduction, mutation, and selection using organic material as nutrients. A distinct class of other theories (panspermia theories) suggests that life was carried to Earth from elsewhere - these theories receive some support from recent work on planetary impact processes. Other alternatives to the standard model suggest that life arose as an inorganic (clay) form and/or that the initial energy source was not organic material but chemical energy or sunlight. We find that the entire range of current theories suggests that liquid water is the quintessential environmental criterion for both the origin and sustenance of life. It is therefore of interest that during the time that life appeared on Earth we have evidence for liquid water present on the surface of Mars.},

We cross-fostered nestlings to create enlarged and reduced broods with the purpose of manipulating parental feeding rates and measured the effect on nestling growth and plumage coloration. Brood size influenced feeding rates to offspring, but the effect varied with season. In general, male nestlings reared in reduced broods were fed more often, weighed more, and displayed brighter structural plumage compared to nestlings reared in enlarged broods. Female nestlings appeared to experience less adverse affects of brood enlargement, and we did not detect an effect of brood-size manipulation on the plumage coloration of female nestlings. Measures of plumage coloration in both males and females, however, were correlated to hatching date and nestling mass during feather development. These data provide empirical evidence that environmental quality can influence the development of the blue structural coloration of feathers and that males may be more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than females.},

While our understanding of post-copulatory mechanisms including sperm competition and cryptic female choice is considerable, our knowledge of courtship and how it influences male and female mating decisions is still extremely poor. Here, we provide the first comprehensive description of male courtship behaviour and vibrations generated in the web by the orb-web spider, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Argiope keyserlingi –{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} a recognised model species. We identified three main elements of male courtship: shudders, abdominal wags and mating thread dances (including both plucks and bounces). The vibrations generated by these behaviours are described in detail. Male shuddering behaviour appears to have a strong influence on female latency to mate acceptance, with males that shudder at high rates without compromising shudder duration being preferred. Shuddering behaviour may also mediate female aggressive behaviour, with males that generate long shudders less likely to be cannibalised after copulation. Male abdominal wagging behaviour, however, appears to have only limited influence on female mating decisions. This study provides avenues for future work that synthesises pre- and post-copulatory mechanisms in web-building spiders to generate an all-encompassing model of how sexual selection operates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based sexual coloration is the classic example of an honest signal of mate quality Animals cannot synthesize carotenoid pigments and ultimately depend on dietary sources. Thus, in carotenoid-poor environments, carotenoid coloration may be a direct indicator of foraging ability and an indirect indicator of health and vigour. Carotenoid coloration may also be affected, more directly, by parasites in some species. Carotenoids are not, however:, the only conspicuous pigments available to animals. Pteridine pigments, with similar spectral properties, are displayed in the exoskeletons and wings of insects, the irides of birds and the skins of fishes, lizards and amphibians. Unlike carotenoids, pteridines are synthesized de novo by animals. We report that the orange spots that male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) display to females contain red pteridine pigments (drosopterins) in addition to carotenoids. We also examined the relationship between drosopterin production by males and carotenoid availability in the field. The results contrasted sharply with the hypothesis that males use drosopterins to compensate for carotenoid scarcity: males used more, not less, drosopterins in streams with higher carotenoid availability The positive association between drosopterin use and carotenoid availability could reflect the costs of drosopterin synthesis or it could be a consequence of females preferring a particular pigment ratio or hue. Male guppies appear to use drosopterin pigments in a manner that dilutes, but does not eliminate, the indicator value of carotenoid coloration.},

	abstract = {Populations of the Caribbean lizard, Anolis roquet, are thought to have experienced long periods of allopatry before recent secondary contact. To elucidate the effects of past allopatry on population divergence in A. roquet, we surveyed parallel transects across a secondary contact zone in northeastern Martinique. We used diagnostic molecular mitochondrial {DNA} markers to test fine-scale association of mitochondrial {DNA} lineage and geological region, multivariate statistical techniques to explore quantitative trait pattern, and cline fitting techniques to model trait variation across the zone of secondary contact. We found that lineages were strongly associated with geological regions along both transects, but quantitative trait patterns were remarkably different. Patterns of morphological and mitochondrial {DNA} variation were consistent with a strong barrier to gene flow on the coast, whereas there were no indications of barriers to gene flow in the transitional forest. Hence, the coastal populations behaved as would be predicted by an allopatric model of divergence in this complex, while those in the transitional forest did not, despite the close proximity of the transects and their shared geological history. Patterns of geographical variation in this species complex, together with environmental data, suggest that on balance, selection regimes on either side of the secondary contact zone in the transitional forest may be more convergent, while those either side of the secondary contact zone on the coast are more divergent. Hence, the evolutionary consequences of allopatry may be strongly influenced by local natural selection regimes.},

The onset of sexual maturity in P. bocagei males involves a change in the ventral (yellow) and dorsal (green) colorations, which is different from immature males (dorsally brownish in color). In I. monticola., males, the ventral coloration also changes to a deep green when they, reach maturity, while the dorsal coloration remains brownish as in the immature specimens. In this species, the green dorsal coloration is acquired gradually after maturity. Only the oldest individuals have a predominantly green dorsal coloration. The differences between the two species in the time males take to acquire I lie green dorsal Coloration could be related to their different longevity. The coloring is acquired gradually in the most long-lived species (I. monticola). A field study was carried our on the behaviour of adult males of L monticola during the reproductive period. The males with green dorsal coloration were seen to pair with females significantly more frequently than chose with the brownish dorsal color. The increase in the green dorsal coloration (Conspicuous) with the size and age of the males of this species would appear to have a clear function as an intersexual or intrasexual signal.},

	abstract = {The assessment of plumage colouration has become a common procedure in many ornithological studies, especially after the discovery of differences between avian and human visual systems, namely the avian ability to perceive ultraviolet wavelengths. There are many techniques available for plumage colour assessment. Nevertheless, unidirectional reflectance spectrometry seems actually to be the method of choice and is used in most studies. The active avian visual communication skills, the physical characteristics of the plumage surface and the birds' body shape prompted us to study plumage colouration with different angles of incidence and observation by bidirectional reflectance spectrometry. In this study, we explore the effect of different angles of incidence and observation, on a single plane of incidence, on the reflectance spectrometric assessment of five differently coloured body regions of the blue fronted Amazon parrot (Amazona aestiva). Measurements were made using a {AVS}-{USB}2000 spectrometer with a {DH}-2000 light source and two different reflection probes (bifurcated fibre optic probe and a specially designed fibre holder). The results of this study illustrate clear angle dependence of colour parameters in differently coloured non-iridescent plumage regions of the blue fronted Amazon parrot. Our results may have direct implications on the observed transmitted information of display and its associated predation risk (trade-off) in birds, but also in other animals. Moreover, the results show that unidirectional reflectance spectrometry alone may be a rather limited procedure to quantify and compare true colour of a complex surface such as birds' plumage. Therefore, slight but behavioural important characteristics of plumage pattern may remain undiscovered with this method.},

	abstract = {Examples of imperfect resemblance between Batesian mimics and their models appear widespread in the natural world, but so far few quantitative models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. I used a simple signal detection model to show that the relationship between model—mimic similarity and mimic effectiveness is typically nonlinear. In particular, I found that there will be little or no further selection to improve model—mimic resemblance beyond a certain level if the model species is costly to attack, if the mimic species is not particularly profitable (e.g., hard to catch), or if the mimic is relatively rare. When there are two different sympatric model species, then mimics should usually evolve a phenotypic similarity to one or the other model species, but not to both. In contrast, when several model species occur in different areas (or emerge at different times) and individual mimics use each of these areas, then the optimal phenotype should be a “ jack-of-all-trades” intermediate phenotype that does not closely resemble any particular model species. Somewhat surprisingly, the theory predicts that if mimics spend an equal amount of time with each model species, then the optimal intermediate phenotype should more closely resemble the least numerous and least noxious model. This phenomenon arises because a vague similarity to an extremely noxious species is usually sufficient to guarantee significant protection, whereas a much closer resemblance to a mildly noxious model species is necessary to afford a similar level of benefit.},

Better understanding of the patterns of exposure, the underlying variability within the human population, and the links between the animal toxicology data and human health effects will improve the evaluation of the risks to human health posed by pesticides. Improving epidemiology studies and integrating this information with toxicology data will allow the human health risks of pesticide exposure to be more accurately judged by public health policy makers.

We found that our catch was strongly male-biased, both at bower sites and at non-bower feeding sites. We continued to observe the bird's behaviour after their release and so sub-divided males into sexual status groups as either bower-owners or nonowners. We searched for morphological measures, subjectively judged colour differences and quantitatively collected spectral measures of the visual properties of the crest feathers that would allow us to separate birds of differing sex and status. We found that bower owners had larger crests than non-owner males or females and that crest area provided the most accurate predictor of a bird's sex and status in a discriminant function analysis. We studied a cohort of seven males who went from non-owners to bower owners over three years, and found that their change in status was accompanied by a change in crest size - the only significant change in their morphology. Crest size did not relate to the mating success of a bower-owner. Instead, we suggest why the crest may differ between status groups and the implications that this may have for the sexual behaviour of male and female Spotted Bowerbirds.},

	abstract = {1. Sexually selected traits often honestly advertise aspects of individual quality, such as immune function. Such traits have traditionally been thought to reveal real-time information (e.g. current health state), but they may also reflect immunological conditions experienced during ontogeny, which can fundamentally shape survival prospects, adult immune function, and reproductive performance. 2. We tested the effects of immune challenges (injections of sheep red blood cells) during neonatal development on adult immune function and ornamental coloration in male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards have a carotenoid-pigmented beak that plays a role in mate choice, and because carotenoids are also associated with immune responsiveness, carotenoid accumulation in body tissues may change as a function of immunological state during development and into adulthood. 3. We found that mallards that received immune challenges at the completion of growth (8-10 weeks old) had a reduced proinflammatory response (as measured by the local swelling response to phytohemagglutinin; {PHA}) as adults, compared to control birds and those receiving immune challenges at other developmental time points. Mallards that received immune challenges during the acquisition of nuptial plumage (13-15 weeks old) had an increased humoral immune response as adults, as assessed by antibody production to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ({KLH}). Body mass, adult beak colour, and carotenoid circulation were not affected by immune challenges issued at any point during development. 4. Circulating carotenoid levels prior to adult immune challenge and change in carotenoid titre over the course of the adult immune assessment period were correlated with degree of response to {PHA} and {KLH} at adulthood, as well as with nitric oxide production, which is associated with innate immunity. However, the direction of these correlations varied by type of immune assessment. Surprisingly, unlike in several previous studies, we found no link between beak coloration and adult immune function. 5. These findings demonstrate the importance of developmental immune challenges in shaping adult immune response, although the precise mechanisms remain unidentified. Moreover, we found support for the hypothesis that carotenoids are linked to immune function, because of the relationship between multiple immune responses and both initial and change in circulating carotenoid levels. 6. However, our study does not support the hypothesis that sexual signal expression reveals developmental immune history. Taken together, our findings suggest that the relationships between carotenoid physiology, carotenoid-based ornamentation, and immune function are complex.},

Optical characterization was carried out on 110 exemplars.

It was found that both the structural and the spectral data allow species identification with an accuracy better than 90 per cent. The reflectance data were further analysed using a colour representation diagram built in a manner analogous to that of the human Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage diagram, but the additional blue visual pigment of lycaenid butterflies was taken into account. It was found that this butterfly-specific colour representation diagram yielded a much clearer distinction of the position of the investigated species compared with previous calculations using the human colour space. The specific colours of the investigated species were correlated with the 285 flight-period data points extracted from museum collections. The species with somewhat similar colours fly in distinct periods of the year such that the blue colours are well tuned for safe mate/competitor recognition.

Such reproductive patterns may select for the evolution of female traits that indicate female phenotypic or genotypic quality among non-role-reversed species. Although attention to the evolution and function of female ornaments is increasing, additional focus is needed on female-specific ornaments (those not expressed in conspecific males) and on nonavian systems in order to gain a broad understanding of how selection acts directly on ornamentation of female animals. In the striped plateau lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, only females develop orange throat patches during the reproductive season. The color peaks in expression near the time of ovulation and appears to stimulate male courtship. Here, I examine whether this female-specific ornament can be used by males to reliably assess female phenotypic quality. Using multivariate regression analyses, I show that the area of the orange color patch predicts body condition and mite load, the chroma (i.e., saturation) of the color patch predicts body size, and both patch area and chroma reliably predict average egg mass. Thus, female reproductive color may function as a condition-dependent signal, indicating phenotypic quality to potential mates.},

The estimate for the total number of species of eukaryotic organisms possible lies in the 5-15 million range, with a best guess of similar to7 million. Species diversity is unevenly distributed; the highest concentrations are in tropical ecosystems. Endemisms are concentrated in a few hotspots, which are in turn seriously threatened by habitat destruction-the most prominent driver of biodiversity loss. For the past 300 years, recorded extinctions for a few groups of organisms reveal rates of extinction at least several hundred times the rate expected on the basis of the geological record.

	abstract = {Male and female European Robins Erithacus rubecula display their red breasts in year-round territorial contests. Despite the clear signalling role of the red breast, little is known about its sexual dimorphism or trends in size when Robins age. We studied these patterns in resident and migrant Robins in a Mediterranean population. Both male and female first-year Robins had smaller red breasts than second-year individuals. Females, but not males, showed a reduction in badge area after the second year of life, leading to sexual dimorphism in red breast area in the oldest Robins. The grey fringe around the red breast showed a steady increase in width in males when ageing, but not in females, also leading to sexual dimorphism in this trait among oldest Robins. The contrast between the red breast and its surrounding grey fringe was higher than that between the breast and the back at both high and low environmental light intensities. This suggests that the grey fringe could function as a frame to highlight the perimeter of the red breast, and that the Robins plumage is equally suited to display in open areas and forest understoreys. Our study suggests that the extent of the red breast and its grey frame could confer information about the age and sex of the birds, and thus be used as a signal in territorial contests and mating decisions.},

Coloured targets were used, with varied chromatic contrast that either did or did not present L-receptor contrast. Better detection correlated with higher chromatic contrast.

It did allow the detection of achromatic targets, but at a lower level than most coloured ones, which indicates that the input from the achromatic system is negligible due to low sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia bacteria are obligatory intracellular parasites of arthropods and have been detected in about 70 species of parasitic wasps and three parasitoid flies. Wolbachia are transmitted cytoplasmically (maternally) and modify host reproduction in different ways to enhance their own transmission: parthenogenesis induction ({PI}), cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), or feminization (F) of genetic males. Only {PI} and {CI} are known in parasitoids. {PI}-Wolbachia cause thelytoky in otherwise arrhenotokous parasitoids by generating diploid (rather than haploid) unfertilized wasp eggs. {CI}-Wolbachia cause incompatibility of crosses between infected males and uninfected females because the paternally derived chromosomes fail to decondense and are destroyed after syngamy. More complex situations arise when hosts harbor multiple infections, which can lead to bidirectional incompatibility and may be involved in parasitoid speciation. The relative fitness of infected and uninfected hosts is important to the population dynamics of Wolbachia, and more data are needed. Evolutionary conflict should be common between host genes, Wolbachia genes, and other "selfish" genetic elements. Wolbachia-specific {PCR} primers are now available for several genes with different rates of evolution. These primers will permit rapid screening in future studies of spatial and temporal patterns of single and multiple infection. Molecular phylogenies show that {CI}- and {PI}-Wolbachia do not form discrete clades. In combination with experimental transfection data, this result suggests that host reproductive alterations depend on the intel action between attributes of both Wolbachia and host. Moreover, Wolbachia isolates from closely related hosts do not usually cluster together, and phylogenies suggest that Wolbachia may have radiated after their arthropod hosts. Both results support considerable horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between host species over evolutionary time. Natural horizontal transmisson between parasitoids and their hosts, or with entomoparasitic nematodes or ectoparasitic mites, remains a tantalizing but equivocal possibility.},

This predicts a tight coevolution between sexual dimorphism and condition dependence and suggests that these patterns of within‐sex and between‐sex variation may share a common genetic and developmental basis. Although condition‐dependent expression of sexual traits is widely documented, the extent of covariation between condition dependence and sexual dimorphism remains poorly known. I investigated the effects of condition (larval diet quality) on multivariate sexual dimorphism in the fly Telostylinus angusticollis (Neriidae). Condition determined the direction of sexual size dimorphism and modulated sexual shape dimorphism by affecting allometric slopes and/or intercepts of sexually homologous traits in both sexes. Although the greatest responses to condition manipulation were observed in male sexual traits, both sexual and nonsexual traits exhibited substantial variation in the nature and magnitude of condition effects. Nonetheless, condition dependence and sexual dimorphism were remarkably congruent: variation in the strength of condition effects on male traits explained more than 90\% of the variation in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism, whether quantified in terms of trait size or allometric slope. The genetic mechanisms that give rise to multivariate sexual dimorphism in body shape thus function in a strongly condition‐dependent manner in this species, suggesting a common genetic basis for body shape variation within and between sexes.},

Ornamental colors have long been studied as honest signals of condition, but few studies have been conducted on how the physiological stress response (i.e., corticosterone ({CORT}) elevation) impacts color expression. We used a traditional capture-and-restraint technique to examine the effect of repeated handling stress on carotenoid-dependent beak coloration in male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Birds subjected to daily, 10-min handling treatments, which elevated circulating {CORT} levels, for a four-week period displayed deeper orange/red beak coloration than did control animals. Stressed males lost body mass during the experiment and marginally decreased in circulating carotenoid concentrations. Hence, handling stress may have reduced food intake or induced mobilization of body stores (i.e., fat) of carotenoids. In contrast to males, stressed females maintained orange beak color, while control females faded in color. This study highlights sex- and pigment-specific mechanisms by which stress may temporarily enhance the expression of sexual traits, but at the expense of other key fitness traits (e.g., body mass maintenance, reproduction).},

It was found that both the structural and the spectral data allow species identification with an accuracy better than 90 per cent. The reflectance data were further analysed using a colour representation diagram built in a manner analogous to that of the human Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage diagram, but the additional blue visual pigment of lycaenid butterflies was taken into account. It was found that this butterfly-specific colour representation diagram yielded a much clearer distinction of the position of the investigated species compared with previous calculations using the human colour space. The specific colours of the investigated species were correlated with the 285 flight-period data points extracted from museum collections. The species with somewhat similar colours fly in distinct periods of the year such that the blue colours are well tuned for safe mate/competitor recognition.

The behavioural significance of these patterns is poorly understood and experiments on this issue have not been reported for free-living reef fish in their natural environment. The damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis has {UV} facial patterns, and spectroradiometric ocular media measurements show that it has the potential for {UV} vision. To test the potential behavioural significance of the {UV} patterns, I studied the response of males, in natural territories on the reef and in aquaria, to two conspecific intruders, one presented in a {UV}-transmitting ({UV}+) container and the other in a {UV}-absorbing ({UV}-) one. Territory owners attacked intruders viewed through {UV}+ filters significantly more often and for longer than intruders viewed through the {UV}- filter. In general, the results of the field experiment confirmed those of the laboratory experiment. The results support the hypothesis that P. amboinensis males are sensitive to {UV} light and that reflectance patterns, which appear in high contrast only in {UV}, modulate the level of aggressive behaviour. A recent survey showed that many predatory fish may not have {UV} vision and the use of {UV} colours in select species of reef fish may therefore serve as a 'private communication channel'.

For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably wilt have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change.

The similarity of the target to non-target stimuli influenced choice responding. In Experiment 2, pigeons learned to detect a target compound when presented with a non-target compound within the same trial under conditions of simultaneity and sequentiality. Non-target trials were arranged to allow for the testing of binding errors (i.e., false identifications of the target on certain non-target trials). Transient evidence for binding errors in two of the birds occurred at the start of two-item training, but decreased with training.

Indirect models predict that ornaments should have a high heritability and that strong positive genetic covariance should exist between fitness and the ornament. Direct models, on the other hand, make no such assumptions about the level of genetic variance in fitness and the ornament, and are therefore likely to be more important when environmental sources of variation are large. Here we test these predictions in a wild population of the blue tit (Parus caeruleus), a species in which plumage coloration has been shown to be under sexual selection. Using 3 years of cross-fostering data from over 250 breeding attempts, we partition the covariance between parental coloration and aspects of nestling fitness into a genetic and environmental component. Contrary to indirect models of sexual selection, but in agreement with direct models, we show that variation in coloration is only weakly heritable (h(2) {\textless} 0.11), and that two components of offspring fitness-nestling size and fledgling recruitment-are strongly dependent on parental effects, rather than genetic effects. Furthermore, there was no evidence of significant positive genetic covariation between parental colour and offspring traits. Contrary to direct benefit models, however, we find little evidence that variation in colour reliably indicates the level of parental care provided by either males or females. Taken together, these results indicate that the assumptions of indirect models of sexual selection are not supported by the genetic basis of the traits reported on here.},

We have studied the optical properties of each type of scales in conjunction with the structural information provided by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and computer simulation. The shining blue color is mainly from the Bragg reflection of the one-dimensional photonic structure, e.g., the shelf structure packed regularly in each ridges on cover scales. A thin-film-like interference effect from the base plate of the cover scale enhances such blue color and further gives extra reflection peaks in the infrared and ultraviolet regions. The analogy in the spectra acquired from the original wing and that from the cover scales suggests that the cover scales take a dominant role in its structural color. This study provides insight of using the biotemplates for fabricating smart photonic structures. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3239513]},

	abstract = {As is the case with any metaphor, parental effects mean different things to different biologists-from developmental induction of novel phenotypic variation to an evolved adaptation, and from epigenetic transference of essential developmental resources to a stage of inheritance and ecological succession. Such a diversity of perspectives illustrates the composite nature of parental effects that, depending on the stage of their expression and whether they are considered a pattern or a process, combine the elements of developmental induction, homeostasis, natural selection, epigenetic inheritance and historical persistence. Here, we suggest that by emphasizing the complexity of causes and influences in developmental systems and by making explicit the links between development, natural selection and inheritance, the study of parental effects enables deeper understanding of developmental dynamics of life cycles and provides a unique opportunity to explicitly integrate development and evolution. We highlight these perspectives by placing parental effects in a wider evolutionary framework and suggest that far from being only an evolved static outcome of natural selection, a distinct channel of transmission between parents and offspring, or a statistical abstraction, parental effects on development enable evolution by natural selection by reliably transferring developmental resources needed to reconstruct, maintain and modify genetically inherited components of the phenotype. The view of parental effects as an essential and dynamic part of an evolutionary continuum unifies mechanisms behind the origination, modification and historical persistence of organismal form and function, and thus brings us closer to a more realistic understanding of life's complexity and diversity.},

We also manipulated the levels of male brightness by using 2 {UV}-transmitting neutral density filters and showed that {UV} reflectance was used specifically for hue discrimination instead of being used for detecting differences in brightness alone.

Over 1100 measurements were made of the strength of the circular polarization, in some cases registering 97\%. Circular polarization had been previously described from five subfamilies of Scarabaeidae and, in the present study, was found in three further subfamilies: Phaenomeridinae, Dynastinae and Euchirinae, as well as in the subfamily Ceratocanthinae of the family Hybosoridae, comprising the first records outside the Scarabaeidae.

Closely related species that mimic one another are particularly likely to face such confusion because of similarities in their courtship behaviour and ecology. We conducted experiments in greenhouse conditions to study interspecific attraction between two mimetic butterfly species, Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. Both species spent considerable time approaching and courting females of the co-mimic species. Experiments using wing models demonstrated the importance of colour pattern in this interspecific attraction. Although males of H. melpomene were attracted to their co-mimics as much as to their own females, H. erato males were more efficient at distinguishing conspecifics, possibly using wing odours. Although preliminary, these results suggest that the use of additional cues may have evolved in H. erato to reduce the cost of convergence in visual signals with H. melpomene. Overall, our results showed that there might be a cost of mimetic convergence because of a reduction in the efficiency of species recognition. Such cost may contribute to explain the apparently stable diversity in Mullerian mimetic patterns in many tropical butterfly assemblages.},

	abstract = {Evidence for the evolution of fertilization incompatibilities and rapid speciation can be biased by the occurrence of hybridization and reproductive endosymbionts such as Wolbachia. For example, patterns of mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) variation can be obscured by mitotypes hitchhiking on extrachromosomal elements like Wolbachia, while such endosymbionts can also induce phenotypes that mirror the operation of intrinsic fertilization incompatibilities between species. Therefore, before strong inferences can be drawn concerning the rates and processes of speciation in arthropod systems, we must first assess whether extrinsic endosymbionts obscure patterns of speciation. Here, I use the Allonemobius fasciatus-socius species complex to determine what role Wolbachia has played in the presumed rapid divergence of this complex by analyzing patterns of {mtDNA} and nuclear {DNA} variation in conjunction with sequence and cytoplasmic incompatibility data on Wolbachia. Data on molecular variation suggest that Wolbachia has not induced a strong selective sweep of the mitochondrial genome; nor does Wolbachia appear to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility. Preliminary evidence indicates that a third species identified within this complex, A. sp. nov. Tex, is partially reproductively isolated from A. socius, its closest relative, via conspecific sperm precedence or some form of postzygotic isolation. Moreover, shared mitotypes between A. sp. nov. Tex and A. socius may indicate the occurrence of a hybrid zone between these species near the border of Texas and Louisiana, although they may also represent shared ancestral polymorphisms. Molecular data also indicate that all three species in this complex diverged from a common ancestor as recently as 3000-30,000 years ago. Finally, the radiation of this complex from its ancestral population likely occurred in the presence of one strain of Wolbachia, thus suggesting a minimal role for Wolbachia during this burst of speciation. In total, barriers to gene flow do appear to have evolved very rapidly in this group of crickets.},

	abstract = {The studied evergreen forest dominated by Quercus ilex showed a leaf area Index ({LAI}) of 4.5, of which 61 \% was accumulated within the tree layer, 30 \% within the shrub layer, and 9 \% within the herb layer. The leaves of all the species were +/- horizontally oriented (41 degrees), absorbing a relevant percentage of incident irradiance. The high {LAI} drastically modified the quality and quantity of solar radiation on the forest underground. The spectral distribution of the radiation under the forest was markedly deficient in blue and red wavelengths. The maximum absorption in these spectral bands was found in spring, when net photosynthetic rate (P-N) was at its maximum, and in summer, when new leaves reached 90 \% of their definitive structure. The vertical radiation profile showed an evident reduction of the red-far red ratio (R/{FR}). Radiation quality and quantity influenced leaf physiology and morphology. Clear differences in leaf size, leaf water content per area ({LWC}) and specific leaf area ({SLA}) on the vertical profile of the forest were observed. All the shrub species showed similar {SLA} (12.02 m(2) kg(-1), mean value). The ability to increase {SLA} whilst simultaneously reducing leaf thickness maximized the carbon economy. The high chlorophyll (Chl) content of shrub layer leaves (1.41 g kg(-1) mean value) was an expression of shade adaptation. Both leaf morphology and leaf physiology expressed the phenotypic plasticity, Q. ilex, Phillyrea latifolia and Pistacia lentiscus of the forest shrub layer showed wide differences in leaf structure and function with respect to the same species developing under strong irradiance (low maquis): a 57 \% mean increase of {SLA} and a 86 \% mean decrease of P-N They showed high leaf plasticity. Leaf plasticity implies that the considered sclerophyllous species has an optimum developmental pattern achieving adaptation to environments.},

These two facets have largely been studied by separate communities using different approaches. This article illustrates with examples some of the ways that considering the evolutionary relationships among species-phylogenies-has helped the study of both past and present species extinction. The focus is on three topics: extinction rates and severities, phylogenetic nonrandomness of extinction, and the testing of hypotheses relating extinction-proneness to attributes of organisms or species. Phylogenetic and taxic approaches to extinction have not fully fused, largely because of the difficulties of relating discrete taxa to the underlying continuity, of phylogeny. Phylogeny must be considered in comparative tests of hypotheses about extinction, but care must be taken to avoid overcorrecting for phylogenetic nonindependence among taxa.},

The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, a manipulator of arthropod reproduction, has been considered to contribute to speciation in several species. A potential role of Wolbachia in sympatric speciation of R. pomonella remains to be tested despite an earlier detection by {PCR}. In this study, we isolated Wolbachia from R. pomonella individuals from both host species using multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}) and the surface protein wsp. By cloning and sequencing of 311 plasmids, we found sequence types of at least four {wPom} strains. A complete {MLST} profile was obtained only for {wPom}1, whereas {MLST} loci of the other putative strains were difficult to assign because of multiple infections and low sample numbers. {wPom}1 occurs in both host races, whereas different sequence types were found at low frequencies only in apple-infesting R. pomonella. This warrants further investigation as it cannot be excluded that Wolbachia plays a part in this model of sympatric speciation.},

However, the extensive variation across taxa in both these components of predator deterrence and the relationship between them are poorly understood. Here we test whether there is a predictive relationship between visual conspicuousness and toxicity levels across 10 populations of the color-polymorphic strawberry poison frog, Dendrobates pumilio. Using a mouse-based toxicity assay, we find extreme variation in toxicity between frog populations. This variation is significantly positively correlated with frog coloration brightness, a viewer-independent measure of visual conspicuousness (i.e., total reflectance flux). We also examine conspicuousness from the view of three potential predator taxa, as well as conspecific frogs, using taxon-specific visual detection models and three natural background substrates. We find very strong positive relationships between frog toxicity and conspicuousness for bird-specific perceptual models. Weaker but still positive correlations are found for crab and D. pumilio conspecific visual perception, while frog coloration as viewed by snakes is not related to toxicity. These results suggest that poison frog colors can be honest signals of prey unpalatability to predators and that birds in particular may exert selection on aposematic signal design.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia infections are a model for understanding intracellular, bacterial symbioses. While the symbiosis is often studied from a binary perspective of host and bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that additional trophic levels can influence the symbiosis. For example, Wolbachia in arthropods harbor a widespread temperate bacteriophage, termed {WO}, that forms virions and rampantly transfers between coinfections. Here we test the hypothesis that temperatures at the extreme edges of an insect's habitable range alter bacteriophage {WO} inducibility and in turn, Wolbachia densities and the penetrance of cytoplasmic incompatibility. We report four key findings using the model wasp, Nasonia vitripennis: First, both cold treatment at 18 C and heat treatment at 30 C reduce Wolbachia densities by as much as 74\% relative to wasps reared at 25 C. Second, in all cases where Wolbachia densities decline due to temperature changes, phage {WO} densities increase and inversely associate with Wolbachia densities. Heat has a marked effect on phage {WO}, yielding phage densities that are 552\% higher than the room temperature control. Third, there is a significant affect of insect family on phage {WO} and endoysmbiont densities. Fourth, at extreme temperatures, there was a temperature-mediated adjustment to the density threshold at which Wolbachia cause complete cytoplasmic incompatibility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that temperature simultaneously affects phage {WO} densities, endosymbiont densities, and the penetrance of cytoplasmic incompatibility. While temperature shock enhances bacteriophage inducibility and the ensuing bacterial mortality in a wide range of medically and industrially-important bacteria, this is the first investigation of the associations in an obligate intracellular bacteria. Implications to a {SOS} global sensing feedback mechanism in Wolbachia are discussed.},

Elliptic Fourier analysis provides complete and accurate descriptions of complex outlines and can be used to reconstruct images accurately. We compared several metrics that summarize overall shape complexity. A new measure of margin roughness is useful for quantifying and comparing margin detail independently of overall shape. Fractal dimension is highly correlated with the ratio of perimeter to area (dissection index) and reveals little additional information about shape. In combination, the summaries of shape complexity provide good discrimination of groups. We used canonical discriminant analysis to compare methods for outlines to traditional morphometric analysis of measurements taken between landmark points.

Precocial chicks that are fed by their parents also vary widely in appearance ranging from those with inconspicuous coloration to those with brightly colored bills, fleshy parts, and plumes. These ornaments are lost by the end of the period of parental dependence, suggesting they function in competition over parental care. We use a comparative approach to evaluate which ecological or life-history variables may have favored the evolution of conspicuous ornamentation in precocial chicks. We compiled data on chick morphology, ecology, and social organization of species in the Family Rallidae, a group with highly variable downy chicks. Chick ornamentation in the form of brightly colored bills, fleshy patches, or plumes is observed in 36 of 97 species for which downy chicks are described. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that nonornamentation is the ancestral state. Chick ornamentation has evolved multiple times within the Rallidae and is significantly associated with large clutch sizes and polygamous mating systems. Chick ornamentation was also weakly associated with adult ornamentation and adult dimorphism. We argue that these results support the hypothesis that lineages with higher levels of sibling competition are more likely to evolve ornamented chicks.},

According to the parasite-mediated sexual selection hypothesis, organism health, parasite resistance and the expression of ornaments are linked. While some studies have analysed the expression of male carotenoid-based ornaments in relation to parasites and immune system capacities, few studies have focused on carotenoid-derived colour patches expressed in both sexes. We analysed the relationships between endoparasite (blood and systemic parasites) loads, haematological values and the components of red mask colour in wild European Goldfinches Carduelis carduelis, a species with a carotenoid-based facial mask in both sexes. Both, males and females were assessed for immune quality and face mask expression. Face mask coloration was sexually dichromatic, males have less orange masks than females. The yellow component of the mask showed less intensity in females infected with Haemoproteus blood parasites. The total leukocyte count was inversely correlated to the yellow component of the mask in females, suggesting that mask colour reflects the immune status of females during the breeding season. Isospora infection appeared to limit the {UV} reflection of the red mask of females.},

	abstract = {The remarkable diversity of coloration and species present in hummingbirds has been considered the result of sexual selection. I evaluate if color differences among species in the genus Coeligena are consistent with expectations from sexual selection theory. If sexual selection on color is important for speciation, closely related species should be markedly different in the colors of feather patches associated with aggression and breeding. I evaluate this prediction through a statistical assessment of the phylogenetic signal of colors from five feather patches: crown, gorget, belly, upper back, and rump. The first two are associated with aggressive and courtship displays and are expected to be under sexual selection, whereas the others are not. Contrary to expectations, the crown and gorget were the only patches with significant phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, I assess if populations of dichromatic species are more divergent in coloration and therefore have reduced gene flow. Color distances among dichromatic subspecies were larger than among monochromatic subspecies, but the magnitude of phenotypic differentiation was not related to levels of gene flow. These results support a role for sexual selection in shaping color variation among populations, but these differences alone are not sufficient to explain speciation.},

To establish the importance of signal efficacy requires evidence that both signals and their detectability to receivers have evolved in response to habitat shifts in a predictable fashion. Here, we test whether habitat structure has predictable effects on the evolution of male and female display coloration in 21 lineages of African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion), based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis. We used quantitative measures of display coloration and estimated signal detectability as the contrast of those colors among body regions or against the background vegetation as perceived by the chameleon visual system. Both male and female display colors varied predictably with different aspects of habitat structure. In several (but not all) instances, habitat‐associated shifts in display coloration resulted in habitat‐associated variation in detectability. While males exhibit a remarkable variety of colors and patterns, female display coloration is highly conserved, consisting in all populations of contrasting dark and light elements. This color pattern may maximize detectability across all habitat types, potentially explaining female conservatism. Overall, our results support the view that selection for signal efficacy plays an important role in the evolution of animal signals.},

	abstract = {Many prey species have evolved defensive colour patterns to avoid attacks. One type of camouflage, disruptive coloration, relies on contrasting patterns that hinder predators' ability to recognize an object. While high contrasts are used to facilitate detection in many visual communication systems, they are thought to provide misleading information about prey appearance in disruptive patterns. A fundamental tenet in disruptive coloration theory is the principle of 'maximum disruptive contrast', i. e. disruptive patterns are more effective when higher contrasts are involved. We tested this principle in highly contrasting stripes that have often been described as disruptive patterns. Varying the strength of chromatic contrast between stripes and adjacent pattern elements in artificial butterflies, we found a strong negative correlation between survival probability and chromatic contrast strength. We conclude that too high a contrast leads to increased conspicuousness rather than to effective camouflage. However, artificial butterflies that sported contrasts similar to those of the model species Limenitis camilla survived equally well as background-matching butterflies without these stripes. Contrasting stripes do thus not necessarily increase predation rates. This result may provide new insights into the design and characteristics of a range of colour patterns such as sexual, mimetic and aposematic signals.},

Here I investigated (a) whether size plasticity in this species is due solely to variations in rearing temperature, or whether photoperiod is also involved, and (b) whether rearing photoperiod affects the timing of ovarian development in adults. Individuals were cultured at temperatures ranging from 21 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and under daylengths of 11.5, 12.5 and 13.5 h in two separate experiments. Significant plasticity in juvenile developmental traits was detected in response to both variables, with cooler temperatures and shorter daylengths both leading to decreased developmental rates and increased size at maturity. Although juveniles grew more slowly with decreasing temperature, they grew faster with decreasing daylength. The timing of ovarian maturation was also related to rearing photoperiod; whereas 'long day' adults (13.5-h photoperiod) had gravid ovaries after 10 days, the ovaries of 'short day' adults (11.5-h photoperiod) were either regressed or nearly so. These preliminary results suggest that size variation observed in field populations of H. bolina may not be wholly accounted for by variations in developmental temperature and, furthermore, that photoperiod may be used by this tropical species as an environmental cue for the seasonal timing of reproduction.},

We tested whether preferences for specific body colours (i.e. plumage and soft parts) were related to colour preferences for grit ingested by birds. Birds eat grit to facilitate break down of food by the gizzard, and this function is independent of the colour of grit, but depends on the physical properties of stones. Bird species were significantly consistent in colour of grit, and grit of different colours varied in prevalence among species, even when analyses were restricted to a sample from a single locality. There were positive correlations between presence of lilac and red grit in the gizzard and presence of sexually dichromatic lilac and red colour on the body. There was a positive correlation between red grit colour and red sexually monochromatic body colour. Bird species with many different sexual colours, but not sexually monochromatic colours on their body had many different colours of grit. Males had more lilac and red grit than females, with this effect differing among species, whereas that was not the case for grit of other colours. These findings are consistent with the sensory bias hypothesis that birds express preferences for grit of specific colours and a high diversity of colours related to sexual colouration of the body, even when the colour of such grit is only visible to the individual at the moment of ingestion.},

	abstract = {1. A growing number of studies suggest that female ornaments are linked to maternal quality and influence male mate choice. These findings challenge the traditional male-biased view of sexual selection and the hypothesis that female ornaments are the outcome of a genetic correlation with male ornaments. To further test the hypothesis that female traits have a function, it is now essential to investigate their honesty and to determine how signalling and reproduction interact in females. If female traits are honest indicators of quality, then they are likely to have a specific signalling function. 2. We investigated whether carry-over effects of reproduction might ensure the honesty of plumage colour signalling of a bird species with conspicuous {UV}-blue and yellow coloration, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. Reproductive effort was manipulated by removing clutches, thereby forcing both sexes to reproduce twice and to raise chicks later in the breeding season when food is less abundant. In the year following this manipulation, we investigated the change in plumage in experimental and control males and females. The change was measured in the two putative feather ornaments, the {UV}-blue cap and the yellow breast, and another feather trait probably less likely to be sexually selected: the wing length. We also tested whether higher-quality females had their coloration less affected by the experiment. 3. We found that control but not manipulated males and females increased their signal towards {UV}. In addition, in the manipulated group, females that were able to lay more eggs had their {UV}-blue coloration less affected by the treatment. For yellow coloration, we found that manipulated yearlings but not manipulated adults decreased their yellow chroma in comparison with control. Lastly, our results show that the condition of the manipulated females tended to be positively correlated with yellow chroma. 4. These results show that the trade-offs between reproduction and signalling can ensure the honesty of conspicuous plumage traits in female and male blue tits. In addition, they suggest that female traits have the potential to evolve under sexual selection in this and other bird species.},

However, no study has documented the use of {UV} signals in salticids. To appreciate the function of {UV} vision, it is necessary to characterize the {UV} colours of salticids. In the present study, the {UV} and human-visible wavelengths of a tropical ornate salticid spider, Cosmophasis umbratica, were analysed using reflectance spectrometry to obtain evidence of sex-specific {UV} colours. An absolute sexual dimorphism in the {UV} colours of this salticid species was found. All of the body parts of adult males that are displayed to conspecifics during intra-specific interactions reflected {UV} (300-400 nm) light, whereas the adult females and juveniles did not reflect {UV} light from any body part. A great deal of variation was also found in the {UV} wavebands among males. This is the first full {UV} characterization of a salticid spider and the first study to demonstrate an extreme sexual {UV} dimorphism in jumping spiders. The findings obtained provide evidence that {UV} reflectance may comprise important sexual signals in jumping spiders. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

Acceptance is particularly perplexing in brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) (hereafter "cowbird") hosts because the eggs of cowbirds and most hosts do not appear to match closely in visual characteristics detectable by humans. However, recent evidence suggests that parasite and host eggs may match in their ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance, undetectable by humans, and that birds may use {UV} signals for egg discrimination. We determined whether egg colour matching in {UV} reflectance separates accepters and rejecters of cowbird parasitism by comparing the total {UV} (300-400 nm) reflectance of the eggs of 11 host species to cowbird eggs. Eggs of three of five accepter species and five of five rejecter species differed significantly from cowbird eggs in {UV} reflectance. We found no significant difference in the {UV} reflectance of the eggs of three closely related pairs of accepter and rejecter species. There also was no significant difference in the {UV} reflectance of cowbird eggs laid in nests of five host species, and the {UV} reflectance of cowbird eggs was not significantly correlated with that of host clutches. Thus, we found no support for the {UV}-matching hypothesis in brown-headed cowbirds and {UV} reflectance does not appear to separate accepters and rejecters of parasitism. Differences in {UV} reflectance between cowbird and host eggs, however, provide potential cues for use in egg discrimination. Experimental testing is needed to determine the relative importance of {UV} reflectance compared to other visual cues.},

In birds, androgens regulate song, aggression, and a variety of sexual ornaments and displays, whereas carotenoids are responsible for the red, yellow, and orange colors of the integument. Parallel, but independent, research lines suggest that the evolutionary stability of each signaling system stems from tradeoffs with immune function: androgens can be immunosuppressive, and carotenoids diverted to coloration prevent their use as immunostimulants. Despite strong similarities in the patterns of sex, age and seasonal variation, social function, and proximate control, there has been little success at integrating potential links between the two signaling systems. These parallel patterns led us to hypothesize that testosterone increases the bioavailability of circulating carotenoids. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated testosterone levels of red-legged partridges Alec-toris rufa while monitoring carotenoids, color, and immune function. Testosterone treatment increased the concentration of carotenoids in plasma and liver by {\textgreater} 20\%. Plasma carotenoids were in turn responsible for individual differences in coloration and immune response. Our results provide experimental evidence for a link between testosterone levels and immunoenhancing carotenoids that W reconciles conflicting evidence for the immunosuppressive nature of androgens, (ii) provides physiological grounds for a connection between two of the main signaling systems in animals, (iii) explains how these signaling systems can be evolutionary stable and honest, and (iv) may explain the high prevalence of sexual dimorphism in carotenoid-based coloration in animals.},

	abstract = {Carnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre-sized underwater suction traps, which have fascinated scientists since Darwin's early work on carnivorous plants. Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5–20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.},

Both mouths and the surrounding flanges show striking and previously unreported peaks of reflectance in the ultraviolet, coupled with high long-wavelength reflectance responsible for the human-visible appearance of the gape. High ultraviolet reflectance is likely to have an important effect on the conspicuousness of nestling mouths, since contrast with the nest background is maximal in the ultraviolet.

	abstract = {Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria transmitted almost exclusively vertically through eggs. In response to this mode of transmission, Wolbachia strategically manipulate their insect hosts' reproduction. In the most common manipulation type, cytoplasmic incompatibility, infected males can only mate with infected females, but infected females can mate with all males. The mechanism of cytoplasmic incompatibility is unknown; theoretical and empirical findings need to converge to broaden our understanding of this phenomenon. For this purpose, two prominent models have been proposed: the mistiming-model and the lock-key-model. The former states that Wolbachia manipulate sperm of infected males to induce a fatal delay of the male pronucleus during the first embryonic division, but that the bacteria can compensate the delay by slowing down mitosis in fertilized eggs. The latter states that Wolbachia deposit damaging "locks'' on sperm {DNA} of infected males, but can also provide matching "keys'' in infected eggs to undo the damage. The lock-key-model, however, needs to assume a large number of locks and keys to explain all existing incompatibility patterns. The mistiming-model requires fewer assumptions but has been contradicted by empirical results. We therefore expand the mistiming-model by one quantitative dimension to create the new, so-called goalkeeper-model. Using a method based on formal logic, we show that both lock-key-and goalkeeper-model are consistent with existing data. Compared to the lock-key-model, however, the goalkeeper-model assumes only two factors and provides an idea of the evolutionary emergence of cytoplasmic incompatibility. Available cytological evidence suggests that the hypothesized second factor of the goalkeeper-model may indeed exist. Finally, we suggest empirical tests that would allow to distinguish between the models. Generalizing our results might prove interesting for the study of the mechanism and evolution of other host-parasite interactions.},

	abstract = {Eggshell colouration is thought to function as a female-specific secondary sexual trait. While tests of this idea are rapidly accumulating in cavity-nesting birds, some fundamental underlying assumptions remain rarely investigated: namely, can males see eggshell coloration and perceive colour differences between the eggs of different females? We tested these two key assumptions in a natural population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Using transponders, we tracked male nest visits and found that all males visited their nest-boxes while eggs were present and often visually accessible. Interestingly, some males also visited neighbouring nests. We then tested whether birds could detect eggshell coloration using models of avian colour vision; models were performed with and without limitations on visual performance owing to dim light. Both models found that differences in eggshell brightness were often easier to discriminate than differences in colour; there was more contrast in white eggshell background between clutches than within and its contrast against nest background was repeatable within clutches, suggesting these features could act as signals. Yet, the detectability of these contrasts depended entirely on model assumptions of visual limitations. Consequently, we need a better understanding of underlying visual mechanisms in dim-light environments and behavioural discrimination experiments before confirming the signalling potential of eggshell coloration.},

Our results show that carotenoids provided to breeding adult hihi were transferred to their offspring and resulted in an intensified orange-yellow flange colour. After accounting for carotenoid supplementation the parameter that most consistently explained variation in nestling flange colour was nestling tarsus length at 23 days, indicating condition dependence of this trait. We did not, however, detect direct effects of carotenoid supplementation on nestling mass or immune response (or any other fitness parameter measured). Carotenoid supplementation did, however, result in an increased paternal provisioning rate.},

	abstract = {While many plant species offer rewards (e.g. nectar) to pollinators, some species, particularly in orchids, do not provide rewards. Ecological factors, such as interactions with rewarding co-flowering species may affect pollinator visitation rates to such deceptive species by influencing pollinator ability to learn to avoid deceptive plants (avoidance learning). We tested the effect of flower colour similarity (similar vs dissimilar) and fine-scale spatial mingling (monospecific vs heterospecific patches) of rewarding and deceptive artificial plants on pollinator visitation in a fully crossed design. We also examined the effect of these factors on learning of initially naive bumblebees. Over time, bumblebees increasingly avoided the deceptive plants, but at a significantly faster rate when deceptive and rewarding plants had dissimilar flower colours than when they were similar. Deceptive plants received more visits when mingled in heterospecific patches with rewarding plants of similar flower colour than when mingled with dissimilar ones. This difference was not significant when rewarding and deceptive plants were spatially separated in monospecific patches. In conclusion, both spatial mingling and flower colour similarity affected pollinator visitation to and avoidance learning of deceptive plants. This proves the validity of artificial experimental systems to study the isolated and joint effect of plant traits, and ecological factors that are crucial for the maintenance of deceptive species in natural populations.},

Infected chicks grew more slowly than uninfected controls, with the effect particularly pronounced on comb length rather than tarsus length or body weight. At sexual maturity, infected roosters had duller combs and eyes, shorter combs and tail feathers, and paler hackle feathers than control roosters. In experimental mate choice tests, females preferred unparasitized over parasitized roosters by about 2: 1, and an analysis of covariance revealed that the hens were using the traits on which the two groups differed to make their mate choice decisions. Finally, in a test of an extension of the Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis, control and infected males were not distinguishable based on non sexually-selected characters such as bill size, suggesting that parasites have a disproportionately larger effect on ornamental traits.},

In this species adult age is positively correlated with large size in spring but with small size in autumn. This shift allowed independent evaluation of the relevance of each variable (size and age) to intrasexual contest success. Observation of a population of marked individuals indicated that only age appeared important, with the winners of pair-wise contests significantly older than losers in both seasons, and with contests lasting longer when the age difference between the combatants was small. Age was also linked to residency; residents won 99\% of all contests. This study suggests that size does not matter in these aerial disputes, but age and residency do. It is not yet possible to determine whether older butterflies are intrinsically better competitors, or whether they simply have greater opportunity to find a vacant territory.},

	abstract = {Descriptions of realized variations, correlations, and covariations among physical attributes (phenotypic integration) provide a useful framework for understanding evolutionary pathways and the generation of diversity. The ability of many birds to see near-ultraviolet ({UV}) light, which is invisible to normal humans, has focused attention on special properties of 'hidden' {UV} plumage signals. Little is known, however, about associations between {UV} (320-400 nm) and longer-wavelength visible (400-700 nm) reflectance, or how such patterns compare to those among longer-wavelength visible reflectance components alone. Analysis of physical reflectance from most carotenoid-bearing yellow, orange, and red plumage patches of male tanager-finch (Thraupini, Emberizinae) species revealed that amounts of longer-wavelength visible and {UV} reflectance components expressed different patterns of covariation with the spectral location of the main longer-wavelength visible reflectance band (cut-off wavelength, associated with 'redness'). Longer-wavelength visible components were linear (y = x) functions of cut-off wavelength, whereas {UV} components were nonlinear cubic polynomial (y = x(3) - x(2) + x) functions of cut-off wavelength. The more complex {UV}-related patterns consisted essentially of two parallel curves partially separated by a gap such that: (1) each curve was associated with a different family of carotenoid pigments and was centred at different (relatively shorter versus longer) cut-off wavelengths; (2) each curve described a negative relationship between the amount of {UV} and the cut-off wavelength; (3) modifications to feather branching structure tracked the negative trend of each curve; (4) the gap between curves existed because plumages with intermediate cut-off wavelengths lacked moderate to high {UV} reflectance; and (5) functional relationships persisted when phylogeny and other confounding effects (age of study skin, breeding season) were taken into account. Thus, phenotypic integration between {UV} and long-wavelength visible reflectance can be just as distinctive as reflectance patterns restricted to the {UV}. Moreover, by contrast to the view that plumage ornaments are relatively unconstrained aspects of morphology, the highly regular phenotypic patterns expressed by carotenoid-bearing plumages suggest that reflectance evolves within specific limits, even in the context of an extensive ecological radiation. Indeed, the near-exhaustive sampling of taxa implies that gaps in the observed phenotype space correspond to plumages that have not evolved in this avian clade. Much of the curve/gap structure is consistent with what is known about the physics, chemistry, and metabolism of carotenoids in these or related birds, including, for example, that only certain subclasses of carotenoids are used for plumage displays. The key contribution that {UV} makes to the expression of these patterns suggests that avian {UV} sensitivity enhances the information content and honesty of carotenoid-bearing plumage signals compared to what humans perceive. The structure of phenotype space reveals that a complex interplay between extrinsic (dietary, ecological) and intrinsic (physico-chemical, physiologic) factors ultimately determines plumage variation.

Increased facial skin yellowness ({CIELab} b*) and lightness (L*) appear healthy in Caucasian faces, but it is unclear why. Skin yellowness is primarily affected by melanin and carotenoid pigments. Melanin (dark and yellow) enhances photoprotection and may be involved in immune defense, but may contribute to vitamin D deficiency. Carotenoids (yellow) signal health in bird and fish species, and are associated with improved immune defense, photoprotection and reproductive health in humans. We present three studies investigating the contribution of carotenoid and melanin to skin color and the healthy appearance of human faces. Study 1 demonstrates similar perceptual preferences for increased skin L* and b* in {UK}-based Caucasian and black South African populations. Study 2 shows that individuals with higher dietary intakes of carotenoids and fruit and vegetables have increased skin b* values and show skin reflectance spectra consistent with enhanced carotenoid absorption. Study 3 shows that, to maximize apparent facial health, participants choose to increase empirically derived skin carotenoid coloration more than melanin coloration in the skin portions of color-calibrated face photographs. Together our studies link skin carotenoid coloration to both perceived health and healthy diet, establishing carotenoid coloration as a valid cue to human health which is perceptible in a way that is relevant to mate choice, as it is in bird and fish species.

	abstract = {Exploitation of hosts by brood parasitic cuckoos is expected to stimulate a coevolutionary arms race of adaptations and counteradaptations. However, some hosts have not evolved defenses against parasitism. One hypothesis to explain a lack of host defenses is that the life-history strategies of some hosts reduce the cost of parasitism to the extent that accepting parasitic eggs in the nest is evolutionarily stable. Under this hypothesis, it pays hosts to accept cuckoo eggs if (1) the energetic cost of raising the cuckoo is low, (2) there is time to renest, and (3) clutch size is small. We parasitized the nests of host and nonhost species with nonmimetic model eggs to test whether the evolution of egg recognition by cuckoo hosts could be explained by life-history variables of the host. The most significant factor explaining rates of rejection of model eggs was whether or not a species was a cuckoo host, with hosts rejecting model eggs at a higher rate than nonhosts. Egg-rejection rates were also explained by visibility within the nest and by cuckoo mass. We found little support for the life-history model of egg rejection. Our results suggest that parasitism is always sufficiently costly to select for host defenses and that the evolution of defenses may be limited by proximate constraints such as visibility within the nest.},

However, their presence can also inform about resource quality by providing inadvertent social information. Few studies have investigated whether foragers perceive conspecifics as informers or competitors. Here, we experimentally tested whether variation in the density of demonstrators ('none', 'low' and 'high'), whose location indicated flower profitability, affected decision-making of bumble-bees Bombus terrestris. Bumble-bees foraged on either 'simple' (two colours) or 'complex' (four colours) artificial floral communities. We found that conspecifics at low density may be used as sources of information in first flower choices, whereas they appeared as competitors over the whole foraging sequence. Low conspecific densities improved foragers' first-visit success rate in the simple environment, and decreased time to first landing, especially in the complex environment. High conspecific densities did not affect these behavioural parameters, but reduced flower constancy in both floral communities, which may alter the efficiency of pollinating visits. These results suggest that the balance of the costs and benefits of conspecific presence varies with foraging experience, floral community and density. Spatio-temporal scales could thus be an important determinant of social information use. This behavioural flexibility should allow bumble-bees to better exploit their environment.},

Analysis of the genetic variation of 89 N. vitripennis specimens from Europe and North America was performed using four types of genetic markers: a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene, nine polymorphic nuclear microsatellites, sequences from 11 single-copy nuclear markers and six Wolbachia genes. The results show that the European populations have a sevenfold higher mitochondrial sequence variation than North American populations, but similar levels of microsatellite and nuclear gene sequence variation. Variation in the North American mitochondria is extremely low (π=0.31\%), despite a highly elevated mutation rate (∼35–40 times higher than the nuclear genes) in the mitochondria of Nasonia. The data are indicative of a mitochondrial sweep in the North American population, possibly due to Wolbachia infections that are maternally co-inherited with the mitochondria. Owing to similar levels of nuclear variation, the data could not resolve whether N. vitripennis originated in the New or the Old World. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria found in many species of arthropods and nematodes. They manipulate the reproduction of their arthropod hosts in various ways, may play a role in host speciation and have potential applications in biological pest control. Estimates suggest that at least 20\% of all insect species are infected with Wolbachia. These estimates result from several Wolbachia screenings in which numerous species were tested for infection; however, tests were mostly performed on only one to two individuals per species. The actual percent of species infected will depend on the distribution of infection frequencies among species. We present a meta-analysis that estimates percentage of infected species based on data on the distribution of infection levels among species. We used a beta-binomial model that describes the distribution of infection frequencies of Wolbachia, shedding light on the overall infection rate as well as on the infection frequency within species. Our main findings are that (1) the proportion of Wolbachia-infected species is estimated to be 66\%, and that (2) within species the infection frequency follows a 'most-or-few' infection pattern in a sense that the Wolbachia infection frequency within one species is typically either very high ({\textgreater}90\%) or very low ({\textless}10\%).},

	abstract = {The brood parasitic common cuckoo Cuculus canorus has a history of coevolution that involves numerous passerine hosts, but today only a subset is known to be regularly parasitised in any area. In some hosts, there is significant variation in the occurrence of parasitism between populations, but still individuals in non-parasitised populations show strong antiparasite defences. In the present study we compared the strength of egg rejection of four distant Fennoscandian brambling Fringilla montifringilla populations experiencing different levels of cuckoo parasitism (0-6\%). Egg rejection ability was in general very well developed and we did not find any population differences in the relationship between egg rejection probability and similarity between host and experimental parasitic eggs. Furthermore, bramblings very rarely made errors in rejection, indicating that selection against rejection behaviour is likely to be very weak. The brambling-cuckoo system therefore differs from other well studied systems which are characterised by pronounced spatial and temporal variation in the host's level of defence. This result is unlikely to reflect independent replication of the same evolutionary trajectory because the weak breeding site tenacity of bramblings should result in an extreme amount of gene flow within the distribution area and thus strongly impede localised responses to selection. Instead, lack of geographic variation has more likely arisen because bramblings respond to selection as one evolutionary unit, and because the average parasitism pressures have been high enough in the past to cause regional fixation of rejection alleles and evolution of clutch characteristics that facilitate cost free egg recognition.},

	abstract = {The coevolutionary process between avian brood parasites and their hosts predicts that low intraclutch variation in egg colour appearance favours egg discrimination of parasite eggs by hosts. Low intraclutch variation would also result in high interclutch variation, which would increase the difficulty of evolution of mimicry by the cuckoo, because many host colour patterns might coexist in the same host population. We explored this possibility using an experimental approach in the common magpie, Pica pica, and great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, system. We artificially parasitized magpie nests with great spotted cuckoo model eggs to assess host response in two populations in Spain (Guadix and Donana) in relation to intraclutch variation in egg appearance, measured by ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectrophotometry. Individuals that rejected model cuckoo eggs had higher intraclutch variation than accepters, suggesting that an increase, rather than a decrease, in intraclutch variation in magpie egg appearance was advantageous for cuckoo egg discrimination.

	abstract = {Learning ability allows insects to respond to a variable environment, and to adjust their behaviors in response to positive or negative experiences. Pollinating insects readily learn to associate floral characteristics, such as color, shape, or pattern, with appetitive stimuli, such as the presence of a nectar reward. However, in nature pollinators may also encounter flowers that contain distasteful or toxic nectar, or offer highly variable nectar volumes, providing opportunities for aversive learning or risk-averse foraging behavior. Whereas some bees learn to avoid flowers with unpalatable or unreliable nectar rewards, little is known about how Lepidoptera respond to such stimuli. We used a reversal learning paradigm to establish that monarch butterflies learn to discriminate against colored artificial flowers that contain salt solution, decreasing both number of probes and probing time on flowers of a preferred color and altogether avoiding artificial flowers of a non-preferred color. In addition, when we offered butterflies artificial flowers of two different colors, both of which contained the same mean nectar volume but which differed in variance, the monarchs exhibited risk-averse foraging: they probed the constant flowers significantly more than the variable ones, regardless of flower color or butterfly sex. Our results add to our understanding of butterfly foraging behavior, as they demonstrate that monarchs can respond to aversive as well as appetitive stimuli, and can also adjust their foraging behavior to avoid floral resources with high variance rewards.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are widespread cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that induce various reproductive alterations in host arthropods, including cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), an incompatibility between sperm and egg that typically results in embryonic death. {CI} has been invoked as a possible mechanism for reproductive isolation and speciation in arthropods, by restricting gene flow and promoting maintenance (and evolution) of genetic divergence between populations. Here we investigate patterns of Wolbachia infection and nuclear and mitochondrial differentiation in geographical populations of the birdnest blowfly Protocalliphora sialia . Blowflies in western North America are infected with two A-group Wolbachia , with some individuals singly and others doubly infected. Individuals in eastern North America mostly show single infections with a B-group Wolbachia. Populations in the Midwest are polymorphic for infections and show A- or B-group infection. There is a low level of mitochondrial divergence and perfect concordance of mitochondrial haplotype with infection type, suggesting that two Wolbachia-associated selective sweeps of the mitochondrion have occurred in this species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of nuclear genetic variation shows genetic differentiation between the eastern-Midwestern and western populations. Both Midwestern and eastern flies infected with A-Wolbachia show eastern nuclear genetic profiles. Current results therefore suggest that Wolbachia has not acted as a major barrier to gene flow between western and eastern-Midwestern populations, although some genetic differentiation between A-Wolbachia infected and B-Wolbachia infected individuals in eastern-Midwestern populations cannot be ruled out.},

Understanding the evolution of multiple ornaments requires knowledge of correlations among ornaments in the same individual and the extent to which ornament expression reflects individual condition and behavior. Variation in four male ornaments in socially monogamous, biparental northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) was related to body size, indices of condition, level of paternal care, and reproductive success. Redness of breast plumage positively predicted body size and negatively predicted nestling feeding rate. Bill color predicted current body condition, with birds with redder bills in better condition. Birds with smaller black face masks had greater reproductive success. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that different ornaments in male cardinals provide information on different aspects of condition and behavior.},

	abstract = {Coevolution of male and female genitalia in waterfowl has been hypothesized to occur through sexual conflict. This hypothesis raises questions about the functional morphology of the waterfowl penis and the mechanics of copulation in waterfowl, which are poorly understood. We used high-speed video of phallus eversion and histology to describe for the first time the functional morphology of the avian penis. Eversion of the 20 cm muscovy duck penis is explosive, taking an average of 0.36 s, and achieving a maximum velocity of 1.6 m s-1. The collagen matrix of the penis is very thin and not arranged in an axial-orthogonal array, resulting in a penis that is flexible when erect. To test the hypothesis that female genital novelties make intromission difficult during forced copulations, we investigated penile eversion into glass tubes that presented different mechanical challenges to eversion. Eversion occurred successfully in a straight tube and a counterclockwise spiral tube that matched the chirality of the waterfowl penis, but eversion was significantly less successful into glass tubes with a clockwise spiral or a 135\{degrees\} bend, which mimicked female vaginal geometry. Our results support the hypothesis that duck vaginal complexity functions to exclude the penis during forced copulations, and coevolved with the waterfowl penis via antagonistic sexual conflict.},

Thus, what could have been the mechanisms that produced peptides/proteins with more amino acids with uncharged R groups than precursors with charged R groups? Should we expect the composition of amino acids adsorbed on minerals to be similar to those of present proteins? Was the adsorption of amino acids on minerals important for the origin of life? The lipid world offers an alternative view of origin of life. Liposomes contributed to elongation of peptides as well as select hydrophobic amino acids and peptides. These experiments could be showing the mechanism, which hydrophobic amino acids have been selected. However, liposomes have no influence on the stereoselectivity in the oligomerization of amino acids. In the present paper, several other mechanisms are also discussed that could produce peptides with a greater proportion of amino acids with uncharged R groups.},

We have recently detected Wolbachia infection in this extensively studied species. C. p. parallelus (Cpp) and C. p. erythropus (Cpe) harbour bacteria from the B and F supergroups, but they differ noticeably in the incidence and type of infection present in their populations. We can distinguish different regional infection patterns that are associated with the distribution of pure and hybrid C. parallelus individuals. The northern pattern of low-level infection characterizes Cpp populations, whereas the southern pattern of high-level infection affects Cpe locations. These patterns converge in the hybrid zone and generate a third infection pattern featuring an extremely high degree of co-infection with the two Wolbachia types in hybrids. The distribution of Wolbachia among the studied populations encourages us to consider the possibility that this bacterium has a significant influence on the origin, maintenance and dynamics of this hybrid zone, given the reproductive alterations that are often associated with Wolbachia.

	abstract = {Genetic diversity is recognized as a fundamental component of biodiversity and its protection is incorporated in several conventions and policies. However, neither the concepts nor the methods for assessing conservation value of the spatial distribution of genetic diversity have been resolved. Comparative phylogeography can identify suites of species that have a common history of vicariance. In this study we explore the strengths and limitations of Faith’s measure of ‘Phylogenetic Diversity’ ({PD}) as a method for predicting from multiple intraspecific phylogeographies the underlying feature diversity represented by combinations of areas. An advantage of the {PD} approach is that information on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity can be combined across species and expressed in a form that allows direct comparison with patterns of species distributions. It also seeks to estimate the same parameter, feature diversity, regardless of the level of biological organization. We extend the {PD} approach by using Venn diagrams to identify the components of {PD}, including those unique to or shared among areas and those which represent homoplasy on an area tree or which are shared across all areas. {PD} estimation should be complemented by analysis of these components and inspection of the contributing phylogeographies. We illustrate the application of the approach using {mtDNA} phylogeographies from vertebrates resident in the wet tropical rainforests of north-east Queensland and compare the results to biodiversity assessments based on the distribution of endemic vertebrate species. The genetic vs. species approaches produce different assessments of conservation value, perhaps reflecting differences in the temporal and spatial scale of the determining processes. The two approaches should be seen as complementary and, in this case, conservation planning should incorporate information on both dimensions of biodiversity. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Red coloration in multicoloured or polymorphic species has been associated with dominance in a number of case studies, including probability of winning in human sports. However, it is not clear at what stage during ontogeny the association between red and the probability of winning contests occurs (or being perceived as more threatening by a contradistinct rival), for example, at conception, early ontogeny or at maturation. We analysed such coloration effects in a polymorphic (red versus yellow) species of lizard, the Australian painted dragon, Ctenophonts pictus. Red males were more likely to win dyadic contests with yellow males when competing for receptive females. When contestants were repainted with a rival's colour, there was a more than 30-fold increase in contest duration. Furthermore, when we tested for red-enhanced contest success in immature males, red was still significantly associated with winning. Thus, the association between red coloration and dominance seems to be set long before a male is naturally involved in sexual contests and could be an innate response to aid facultative fight or submission decisions, particularly in young males. To assess in situ selective benefits of the polymorphism, we released males in polymorphic and monomorphic groups. Males from polymorphic groups survived better, implying that polymorphism among neighbouring territorial males in the wild results in selective benefits.

	abstract = {Functional diversity is the diversity of species traits in ecosystems. This concept is increasingly used in ecological research, yet its formal definition and measurements are currently under discussion. As the overall behavior and consistency of functional diversity indices have not been described so far, the novice user risks choosing an inaccurate index or a set of redundant indices to represent functional diversity. In our study we closely examine functional diversity indices to clarify their accuracy, consistency, and independence. Following current theory, we categorize them into functional richness, evenness, or divergence indices. We considered existing indices as well as new indices developed in this study. The new indices aimed at remedying the weaknesses of currently used indices (e.g., by taking into account intraspecific variability). Using virtual data sets, we test (1) whether indices respond to community changes as expected from their category and (2) whether the indices within each category are consistent and independent of indices from other categories. We also test the accuracy of methods proposed for the use of categorical traits. Most classical functional richness indices either failed to describe functional richness or were correlated with functional divergence indices. We therefore recommend using the new functional richness indices that consider intraspecific variability and thus empty space in the functional niche space. In contrast, most functional evenness and divergence indices performed well with respect to all proposed tests. For categorical variables, we do not recommend blending discrete and real-valued traits (except for indices based on distance measures) since functional evenness and divergence have no transposable meaning for discrete traits. Nonetheless, species diversity indices can be applied to categorical traits (using trait levels instead of species) in order to describe functional richness and equitability.},

Arthropods and nematodes are important protagonists in human health because either they act as vectors of pathogens (bacteria, protozoa, viruses or fungus), or are themselves parasites. Fighting infectious diseases is based essentially on vaccination (prevention) or chemotherapeutic (curative) approaches in human, but one can envisage as an alternative to reduce the number of vectors or limit their ability to spread pathogens. Such strategies controling dissemination will undoubtedly benefit from the knowledge accumumulated by recent works on powerful mechanisms developped by symbiotic insect bacteria such as Wolbachia to popagate in arthropods and nematods.

Humans cannot distinguish males from females both sexes are brightly colored with a chestnut throat patch, a yellow chin, and green body coloration fading into a turquoise-blue rump and tail. We quantified coloration with ultraviolet-({UV}) visible spectrometry and measured morphology to determine the extent of sexual dichromatism and dimorphism. Males displayed more exaggerated coloration, longer tail streamers, and were larger than females. Multiple plumage ornaments (measures of plumage coloration and streamer length) were positively correlated in both sexes. Males in better body condition expressed darker chestnut throats and more chromatic green body plumage. Females in better body condition, however, exhibited more chromatic blue rumps and yellow chins.

	abstract = {High-latitude warming could cause northern peatlands to become C sources. Where peattands border boreal forests, strong differences in ecosystem C balances reflect drainage differences. Because local drainage conditions could be influenced by alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, peatland-forest ecotones represent useful locations for monitoring potential impacts of global warming. We characterized the soils, hydrology, and forest structure along transects bracketing a peatland-forest ecotone in southeastern Alaska. We expected to find soil properties and processes at the peatland-forest edge that were intermediate between those from peatland and forest. Instead, we found that above- and belowground features of the ecotone did not coincide. Conifers grew on mineral soils, but also grew on Cryofibrists and Cryohemists, soils with high soil organic C ({SOC}) contents to 100 cm (57 kg m(-2)) that are significantly greater than the {SOC} contents of adjacent forested, non-Histosol pedons. Soil ;respiration rates ({SRR}) at peatland-forest edges (0.08 g {CO}2-C m(-2) h(-1)), by contrast, were threefold lower than forest rates and did not differ significantly from peatland rates. Respiration rates were strongly influenced by water table height. Peattand and edge water tables were both significantly shallower than forest water tables. Our conceptual model suggests that if additional forest expansion and warmer summers enhance drainage of these edge soils and stimulate {SRR} to forest-like levels, 23 kg C m(-2) could ultimately be mineralized from these extensive peatland-forest boundaries. Afforestation of peattand margins under this scenario could represent a transient positive feedback to rising atmospheric {CO}2 levels.},

There are three main phenotype classes: pale, intermediate and melanic. In natural populations, the proportion of melanics seems to be stable at a low frequency, usually 3-4 per cent. An hypothesis about possible selective differences between melanics vs. non-melanics was evaluated in a 2-year field experiment. Bird predation was prevented in a large number of spruce branches, the natural habitat of the species, by means of coarse-meshed nets. The experimental branches and the controls were sampled four times (spring and autumn in 2 years). Bird predation was shown to affect negatively the spider abundance. Removal of bird predation increased the P. phrygianus mean density between 2.3 and 10.5 times the control density. However, no difference in the proportion of melanics in experimental vs. control branches could be established. It is suggested that bird predation is not a major selective force affecting the phenotype proportions. Hence, the mechanism of maintenance of melanism in natural populations of P. phrygianus is unclear, but some alternative explanations are discussed.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. The use of feathers as nest lining material has traditionally been explained by the thermoregulatory properties of feathers. Feather nest lining could additionally affect nest detectability by predators, or play a role in a sexually selected context. Furthermore, feather nest lining harbours microorganisms that may influence environmental conditions where eggs and nestlings develop. 2. Microorganisms growing on nest lining feathers could affect the bacterial load of eggshells because they occupy space and/or produce antimicrobial substances against other bacteria, including egg pathogens. Feathers of different colours are known to differ in their bacterial community (i.e. feather degrading bacteria) and, thus, colour composition of nest lining feather could also affect the bacterial environment of avian nests. 3. Here we tested this hypothesis in the barn shallow (Hirundo rustica) by exploring the relationship between eggshell bacterial loads and number of feathers, and the effect of experimentally modified colour composition of nest lining feathers on eggshell bacterial load. 4. In agreement with the hypothesis we found that, before treatment, the number of nest lining feathers (mainly that of unpigmented-white colour) predicted eggshell bacterial load, and that, at the end of the incubation period, eggshells of experimental nests with white feathers had a lower bacterial density than those in experimental nests with black feathers. 5. We failed to detect a relationship between bacterial load and hatching success. However, since evidence of that relationship exists for other species, these results would explain the previously detected experimental effect of colour composition of nest lining feathers on hatching success of swallows. 6. Nest design in general, and the use of nest-lining white feathers in particular, may therefore have important consequences for reproductive success of birds. The reduced eggshell bacterial loads of experimental white nests would explain preferences by barn swallows for feathers of white colour.},

The reflective stripes contain a dense layer of physiologically active iridophores, which act as multilayer reflectors. The wavelengths reflected by these stripes can change from blue to red in 0.25 s. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the iridophore cells contain plates that are, on average, 51.4 nm thick. This thickness produces a stack, which acts as an ideal quarter-wavelength multilayer reflector (equal optical thickness of plates and spaces) in the blue, but not the red, region of the spectrum. When skin preparations were placed into hyposmotic physiological saline, the peak wavelength of the reflected light shifted towards the longer (red) end of the visible spectrum. Hyperosmotic saline reversed this effect and shifted the peak wavelength towards shorter (blue/{UV}) wavelengths. Norepinephrine (100 \{micro\}mol l-1) shifted the peak wavelength towards the longer end of the spectrum, while adenosine (100 \{micro\}mol l-1) reversed the effects of norepinephrine. The results from this study show that the wavelength changes are elicited by a change of [{\textasciitilde}]70 nm in the distance between adjacent plates in the iridophore cells.},

However signaling functions ascribed to plumage imply that plumage coloration is the outcome of an evolutionary process based on genetic variation. By means of a cross-fostering design we show significant effects of both a common rearing environment and the brood from which a nestling originally came from (common origin) on the plumage coloration of nestling great tits (Parus major). This demonstration of origin-related variation in carotenoid-based plumage coloration suggests that the observed variation of the trait has a partial genetic basis. Consistent with environmental determination of this trait, we also found a significant positive correlation between the color saturation of nestlings and their foster-father's plumage. There was no significant correlation between nestling plumage coloration and the food quantity provided to the nestlings by the male, the female, or both parents. This suggests that the nestling-foster father correlation arises by the carotenoid quantity ingested rather than the food quantity per se. No significant nestling-true father correlation was found, which suggests that nestling plumage coloration did not indirectly evolve due to sexual selection. Consistent with this result there was no significant correlation between the nestling's plumage color and its coloration as a breeding adult the following year, suggesting that nestling plumage color is a different trait than the first year plumage.},

	abstract = {Background: Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are reproductive parasites widespread among arthropods. The most common effect arising from the presence of Wolbachia in a population is Cytoplasmic Incompatibility ({CI}), whereby postmating reproductive isolation occurs in crosses between an infected male and an uninfected female, or when a male is infected with a different strain of Wolbachia to that of the female (bidirectional {CI}). Previous theoretical models have demonstrated that bidirectional {CI} can contribute to the genetic divergence of populations in haploid and diploid organisms. However, haplodiploid organisms were not considered in these models even though they include Nasonia parasitoid wasps - the best example of the implication of Wolbachia in ongoing speciation. Moreover, previous work did not investigate inbreeding mating systems, which are frequently observed in arthropod species. Results: We developed a stochastic two-island model which simulated three genetic scenarios, diploidy, haploidy, and haplodiploidy, with two {CI} phenotypes being considered for the latter: (1) male development of female progeny; and (2) mortality of fertilized eggs. We also investigated the effect of varying the proportion of sib mating. In the model each allopatric population was initially fixed for a single allele at a nuclear locus under positive selection and infected with one strain of Wolbachia. Each simulation presupposed that the two populations were fixed for a different allele and a different strain of Wolbachia. The degree of genetic differentiation observed in the locus under selection due to bidirectional {CI} was much lower for the two haplodiploid phenotypes than for either diploids or haploids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sib-mating may compensate for the lower efficiency of bidirectional {CI} in haplodiploids by maintaining genetic divergence. Conclusion: Our model suggests that maintenance of genetic differentiation facilitated by Wolbachia is more likely to occur in diploids and haploids than in haplodiploids. However, increasing the level of sib-mating may compensate for the weak effect of bidirectional {CI} in haplodiploids. Our work therefore gives a potential explanation for why the haplodiploid Nasonia species, which are infected with bidirectionally incompatible Wolbachia strains and undergo sib-mating, have differentiated genetically and maintained this differentiation without premating isolation.},

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based coloration in adult birds has been often regarded as an honest signal of individual quality. However, few studies have demonstrated a link between carotenoid display and the quantity or quality of resources provided to the offspring. The present study investigated the expression of a carotenoid-based ornament, the breast plumage yellowness of the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, in relation to the level of parental provisioning effort and the amount of carotenoid-rich prey provided to the young. The study was conducted in two forest types (evergreen and deciduous), which also allowed an exploration of the possible existence of habitat effects on the coloration of breeding birds. It was found that plumage colour intensity (carotenoid chroma) correlated positively with nestling provisioning rates of both males and females, supporting the good parent hypothesis. In addition, carotenoid chroma was positively related with the proportion of Lepidoptera larvae brought to the nest in both sexes. Female but not male coloration was positively linked to breeding success (proportion of fledged young). Nestling coloration did not correlate with that of their parents, nor the frequency with which they were fed. Hue and lightness of nestling's plumage correlated positively with body mass and tarsus length, respectively. The results obtained in the present study indicate that ventral plumage coloration in blue tits may advertise the ingested carotenoids (carotenoid foraging ability) and also their overall parental quality in terms of nestling provisioning rates. This suggests that plumage yellowness can be used as an indicator of foraging ability in this species.

	abstract = {Animal color patterns are a compromise between sexual selection pressures that increase advantages accrued from conspicuousness, and natural selection pressures that decrease those advantages through reduced survivorship. Predation pressure, as a mode of natural selection, often is invoked as a counter-selective force to sexual selection, yet few studies have demonstrated empirically that more conspicuous individuals experience higher rates of predation. We quantified predator attacks on models of collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, in three well-studied populations (Oklahoma, {USA}). These populations differ in coloration and in visual backgrounds against which the lizards are viewed by conspecifics and predators. Attack frequencies varied considerably among study sites but at all sites the models exhibiting the strongest color contrast with local rocks were detected and attacked most often. By comparison, inconspicuous models of females were never attacked at any of the sites. These results suggest a survival cost of conspicuous coloration in collared lizards, and reiterate the importance of considering the visual environment as well as differences among populations when examining the influence of predation on the evolution of animal color patterns.},

The impact of endoparasites on plumage brightness has only recently been demonstrated experimentally. We tested the impact of ectosymbionts, in particular feather mites, on plumage brightness, using 2 years of observational data and experiments in the field. The abundance of feather mites during moult was negatively correlated with brightness and saturation of plumage coloration developed by male serins. The application of an insecticide before moult resulted in experimental males developing a brighter plumage than control individuals. Experimental adult males, but not juveniles, also developed more saturated plumages in one of the years, but did not differ from controls in the other year. This is the first experimental demonstration that ectosymbionts (including mites) have a negative impact on the characteristics of the plumage developed and consequently can signal the healthiness of their hosts.

Here we report comparative behavioral data of color and grating learning and memory for A. cerana and A. mellifera in China, gathered using a Y-maze apparatus. We show for the first time that the learning and memory performance of A. cerana is significantly better on both color and grating patterns than that of A. mellifera. This study provides the first evidence of a learning and memory difference between A. cerana and A. mellifera under controlled conditions, and it is an important basis for the further study of the mechanism of learning and memory in honeybees.},

	abstract = {Recent behavioural experiments have shown that birds use ultraviolet ({UV})-reflective and fluorescent plumage as cues in mate choice. It remains controversial, however, whether such {UV} signals play a special role in sexual communication, or whether they are part of general plumage coloration. We use a comparative approach to test for a general association between sexual signalling and either {UV}-reflective or fluorescent plumage. Among the species surveyed, 72\% have {UV} colours and there is a significant positive association between {UV} reflectance and courtship displays. Among parrots (Psittaciformes), 68\% of surveyed species have fluorescent plumage, and again there is a strong positive association between courtship displays and fluorescence. These associations are not artefacts of the plumage used in courtship displays, being generally more 'colourful' because there is no association between display and colours lacking {UV} reflectance or fluorescence. Equally, these associations are not phylogenetic artefacts because all results remain unchanged when families or genera, rather than species, are used as independent data points. We also find that, in parrots, fluorescent plumage is usually found adjacent to {UV}-reflective plumage. Using a simple visual model to examine one parrot, the budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus, we show that the juxtaposition of {UV}-reflective and fluorescent plumage leads to a 25-fold increase in chromatic contrast to the budgerigar's visual system. Taken together, these results suggest that signals based on {UV} contrast are of special importance in the context of active sexual displays. We review briefly six hypotheses on why this may be the case: suitability for short-range signalling; high contrast with backgrounds; invisibility to predators; exploitation of pre-existing sensory biases; advertisement of feather structure; and amplification of behavioural signals.},

	abstract = {Many features of global diversity compilations have proven robust to continued sampling and taxonomic revision. Inherent biases in the stratigraphic record may nevertheless substantially affect estimates of global taxonomic diversity. Here we focus on short-term (epoch-level) changes in apparent diversity. We use a simple estimate of the amount of marine sedimentary rock available for sampling: the number of formations in the stratigraphic Lexicon of the United States Geological Survey. We find this to be positively correlated with two independent estimates of rock availability: global outcrop area derived from the Paleogeographic Atlas Project (University of Chicago) database, and percent continental flooding. Epoch-to-epoch changes in the number of formations are positively correlated with changes in sampled Phanerozoic marine diversity at the genus level. We agree with previous workers in finding evidence of a diversity-area effect that is substantially weaker than the effect of the amount of preserved sedimentary rock. Once the mutual correlation among change in formation numbers, in diversity, and in area flooded is taken into consideration, there is relatively little residual correlation between change in diversity and in the extent of continental flooding. These results suggest that much of the observed short-term variation in marine diversity may be an artifact of variation in the amount of rock available for study. Preliminary results suggest the same possibility for terrestrial data. Like the comparison between change in number of formations and change, in sampled diversity, which addresses short-term variation in apparent diversity, the comparison between absolute values of these quantities, which relates to longer-term patterns, also shows a positive correlation. Moreover, there is no clear temporal trend in the residuals of the regression of sampled diversity on number of formations. This raises the possibility that taxonomic diversity may not have increased substantially since the early Paleozoic. Because of limitations in our data, however, this question must remain open.},

Male crickets produce a calling song to attract females and then switch to a courtship song that incites mounting by females once they are at close range. Although we know much about the genetics of cricket calling song, no study has yet examined the quantitative genetics of courtship song. Here, we conduct a quantitative genetic analysis of courtship song using the Australian cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. We find substantial levels of additive genetic variation in courtship song parameters and genetic covariances between courtship song parameters that reflect female preferences. We also found evidence for a negative relationship between the amount of trill in the courtship song and the ability of males to mount an immune response and to produce an ejaculate containing a high proportion of viable sperm. Trade-offs between immunity and sexual signaling are a prerequisite for immunocompetence handicap models of preference evolution, whereas a trade-off between gaining matings and fertilizations is a fundamental assumption underlying sperm competition theory. These life-history trade-offs are likely to constrain evolutionary responses to selection from female choice, and to maintain additive genetic variance in courtship song.},

	abstract = {In many animals, an individual's social environment and status can change quickly and unpredictably, suggesting an advantage for signals capable of responding to these changes. However, many signaling traits are fixed for relatively long periods. In birds, for example, most plumage-based signals are constrained by molt and unable to respond to sudden changes in social environment. Soft parts, conversely, are vascularized and may provide an alternative signaling system that can be updated relatively quickly. In this study, the effects of changes in breeding status are documented for a putative plumage-based signal, plumage brightness, and a putative soft part signal, bill darkness, in the red-backed fairy-wren Malurus melanocephalus. Males that switched from unpaired helper to paired breeder within a breeding season developed significantly darker bills within three weeks of the switch relative to males that did not change status. There was no clear corresponding change in plumage brightness, though the data suggests that changes in plumage brightness are at least possible. These results suggest that bill color is a socially mediated trait capable of responding rapidly to changes in breeding status, and it is proposed that the importance of soft parts as labile signals in birds may be currently under-appreciated.},

	abstract = {Among several adaptive explanations proposed to account for variation in avian egg color, that related to sexual selection is of particular interest because of its possible generality. Briefly, it proposes that because biliverdin (the pigment responsible for blue-green eggshell coloration) is an antioxidant, deposition in the eggshell by laying females may signal the capacity of females to control free radicals, despite the handicap of removing this antioxidant from their body. If males adjust parental effort in response to the intensity of the blue coloration of eggs, thereby investing more in the offspring of high-quality mates, blue eggs may represent a postmating sexually selected signal in females. Here, by image and spectrophotometric analyses of the eggs of European passerines, we tested two different predictions of the hypothesis. First, variables related to intraspecific variation in parental effort (i.e., the duration of the nestling period controlled for body mass) should be positively related to the intensity of blue-green color of the eggshell across species. Second, there should be a positive relationship between intensity of blue-green color of eggs and degree of polygyny. These predictions were supported: intensity of blue-green coloration (i.e., chroma) was significantly related to the duration of the nestling period and to degree of polygyny after controlling for possible confounding variables (i.e., body mass, incubation period, and nest type) and similarity due to common descent. Nest type (hole or nonhole) also explained a significant proportion of variation in egg chroma, perhaps reflecting different selection pressures (i.e., light conditions, risk of parasitism) affecting species with the two types of nests.},

We examined sexual responses of female guppies to a previous mate versus a novel male (experiment 1) or to a male with a colour pattern similar to that of the previous mate versus a novel male (experiment 2). Females showed significantly more sexual responses to courtship by novel males than to previous mates in experiment 1 or to males that resembled previous mates in experiment 2. These results suggest that females discriminate actively against previous mates, and extend this discrimination to males with similar colour patterns to previous mates. This could lead to negative frequency-dependent sexual selection against common colour patterns (a 'redundant male effect'), which could contribute to the maintenance of the extraordinarily high levels of genetic polymorphism in guppy colour patterns.},

	abstract = {The functional significance of bird egg color and patterning is a continuing Subject of interest and debate. Extreme polymorphism in eggshell appearance is often thought to be maintained by frequency-dependenr selection operating within populations. However, variation could also be explained by small-scale differentiation combined with limited migration. Here, we report the existence of extreme variation in egg color in a Population of Mexican Jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina) inhabiting a steep elevation and habitat gradient within a single mountain range, the Sierra del Carmen of Coahuila, Mexico. {WC} quantified egg color of 14.3 eggs from 54 nests throughout the mountain range, using digital photos. Color was also quantified for a Subset of these eggs, using a spectrometer. Results from both methods Support the conclusion that egg color has diverged at a remarkably small spatial scale of 3-15 km. Photo color quantification indicated that eggs at high elevation were greener than those at low elevation. Spectrometer results supported this conclusion, with more-pigmented (i.e., less reflectant) eggs occurring at high elevation. Unlike in other species, differences in condition do not seem to drive these divergence patterns in egg color. Further study is needed to determine to what extent differences result from heritable genetic change attributable to divergent selection pressures or from an environmentally induced phenotypic response.

Second, covering the compound eyes with silver paste significantly decreased visual acquisition, while covering the ocelli did not. Third, there was no significant difference in the visual acquisition between nurse bees, guard bees, and foragers. Fourth, bees conditioned with a 540-nm light stimulus exhibited light-induced {PER} with a 618-nm, but not with a 439-nm light stimulus. Finally, bees conditioned with a 540-nm light stimulus exhibited {PER} immediately after the 439-nm light was turned off, suggesting that the bees reacted to an afterimage induced by prior adaptation to the 439-nm light that might be similar to the 540-nm light.},

Although there is considerable evidence that many male plumage traits function as status signals that convey information about fighting ability, less is known about status signaling in females. We tested whether the carotenoid-based orange breast coloration of the female streak-backed oriole (Icterus pustulatus pustulatus) signals status during territorial interactions. To do this, we simulated territorial intrusions using taxidermic models and compared the roles of the sexes within pairs during territorial defense directed toward different types of simulated intruders. Females were more territorial than their mates during the breeding season, whereas males were more territorial than their mates in the nonbreeding season, contrary to patterns seen in studies of temperate zone birds. The coloration of simulated female intruders also influenced territorial responses: When presented with color-augmented female models, females responded with greater intensity than their mates, whereas the intensity of defense was similar for both sexes when presented with average-colored female models. The greater female response to more colorful intruders suggests that females perceive more ornamented females as greater threats to their territorial tenure or to their pair bond. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that female carotenoid-based coloration signals status in this species.},

	abstract = {Mimetic wing coloration evolves in butterflies in the context of predator confusion. Unless butterfly eyes have adaptations for discriminating mimetic color variation, mimicry also carries a risk of confusion for the butterflies themselves. Heliconius butterfly eyes, which express recently duplicated ultraviolet ({UV}) opsins, have such an adaptation. To examine bird and butterfly color vision as sources of selection on butterfly coloration, we studied yellow wing pigmentation in the tribe Heliconiini. We confirmed, using reflectance and mass spectrometry, that only Heliconius use 3-hydroxy-{DL}-kynurenine (3-{OHK}), which looks yellow to humans but reflects both {UV}-and long-wavelength light, whereas butterflies in related genera have chemically unknown yellow pigments mostly lacking {UV} reflectance. Modeling of these color signals reveals that the two {UV} photoreceptors of Heliconius are better suited to separating 3-{OHK} from non-3-{OHK} spectra compared with the photoreceptors of related genera or birds. The co-occurrence of potentially enhanced {UV} vision and a {UV}-reflecting yellow wing pigment could allow unpalatable Heliconius private intraspecific communication in the presence of mimics. Our results are the best available evidence for the correlated evolution of a color signal and color vision. They also suggest that predator visual systems are error prone in the context of mimicry.},

Males are selectively territorial against conspecific males. Virgin females accept only conspecific males, probably chosen by wing color. Females are nonterritorial and spend most of their adult activity ovipositing on the correct larval food plants. Eyes of both species contain four spectral types of visual pigments (P360, P437, P500, and P568) but the distribution of these pigments within the receptor mosaic is quite different between both species and sexes. The ventral eye region of L. heteronea is tetrachromatic but that of L. rubidus is trichromatic, lacking the blue-sensitive visual pigment P437. The dorsal eye region of males of both species is dichromatic (P360 and P437). Visual-pigment spectra and wing-reflectance spectra are well matched for effective discrimination of wings of conspecific males from those of other species. The dorsal region of female eyes is trichromatic, containing P360, P437, and P568. The third visual pigment, P568, is important for long-range detection by ovipositing females of red coloration on Eriogonum and Rumex food plants. P568 has the same absorbance spectrum as the human red-cone and is considerably red-shifted compared to the P530 possessed by most insects. That the sexes and closely related species can have such major differences in distribution of visual pigments indicates that the visual system is as readily altered as wing coloration in the course of adaptive evolution.},

We studied female ornamentation in the socially monogamous, biparental northern cardinal to determine whether expressions of multiple ornaments correlate with aspects of female condition and behaviour. Expressions of the ornamental red-orange bill, red underwing feathers, head crest and blackish face mask were compared to several measures of condition, parental behaviour and intrasexual aggression. Red-orange bill colour of females was correlated with both body size and an index of body condition. Redness of the underwing feathers was correlated with body size, body condition, date of first nest produced and reproductive success. Face mask expression was correlated with both nestling feeding rate and level of intrasexual aggression. The length of head crest feathers did not correlate with any measured aspect of condition or behaviour. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ornaments in female cardinals provide redundant information to prospective mates on aspects of female condition and behaviour.

	abstract = {Spiders in the Orbiculariae spin orb webs that dissipate the mechanical energy of their flying prey, bringing the insects to rest and retaining them long enough for the spider to attack and subdue their meals. Small prey are easily stopped by webs but provide little energetic gain. While larger prey offer substantial nourishment, they are also challenging to capture and can damage the web if they escape. We therefore hypothesized that spider orb webs exhibit properties that improve their probability of stopping larger insects while minimizing damage when the mechanical energy of those prey exceeds the web's capacity. Large insects are typically both heavier and faster flying than smaller prey, but speed plays a disproportionate role in determining total kinetic energy, so we predicted that orb webs may dissipate energy more effectively under faster impacts, independent of kinetic energy per se. We used high-speed video to visualize the impact of wooden pellets fired into orb webs to simulate prey strikes and tested how capture probability varied as a function of pellet size and speed. Capture probability was virtually nil above speeds of {\textasciitilde}3 m s−1. However, successful captures do not directly measure the maximum possible energy dissipation by orb webs because these events include lower-energy impacts that may not significantly challenge orb web performance. Therefore, we also compared the total kinetic energy removed from projectiles that escaped orb webs by breaking through the silk, asking whether more energy was removed at faster speeds. Over a range of speeds relevant to insect flight, the amount of energy absorbed by orb webs increases with the speed of prey (i.e. the rates at which webs are stretched). Orb webs therefore respond to faster – and hence higher kinetic energy – prey with better performance, suggesting adaptation to capture larger and faster flying insect prey. This speed-dependent toughness of a complex structure suggests the utility of the intrinsic toughness of spider silk and/or features of the macro-design of webs for high-velocity industrial or military applications, such as ballistic energy absorption.},

	abstract = {Goldfish have a tetrachromatic color vision with a high discrimination ability for spectral colors as well as for object colors. We investigate the question whether goldfish organize the high number of discriminable colors in terms of color categories, i.e. in a few larger groups of colors independent of wavelength discrimination. Twenty-four goldfish were trained with food reward, each fish on one out of 13 wavelengths between 371 nm and 630 nm. In transfer tests two different wavelengths were presented, one shorter and one longer than the training wavelength, and the choice behavior was determined. Choice frequencies of {\textgreater}= 50\% were assumed to indicate similarity to the training color. The wavelength ranges {\textgreater}= 50\% were about 100 nm and twice as large as the just noticeable differences measured in wavelength discrimination tests (Fig. 7). The ranges were surprisingly about the same for all training wavelengths, provided the data were plotted on a wavelength scale weighted according to discrimination ability (Fig. 4). Thus, with the training method chosen goldfish showed a kind of categorization which, however, depends on training wavelength and discrimination ability. Generalization tests in which training wavelength and test wavelengths were shown separately for 2 min each gave the same results as wavelength discrimination tests (Figs. 5 and 6) and are, therefore, not indicative for color categories.},

	abstract = {The intensity of sexual selection is influenced by environmental conditions because these conditions influence signal propagation and the risks of the signal being exploited by predators and parasites. We explore the possibility that spatial or temporal heterogeneity in environmental signalling conditions (in this case light spectrum) may induce fluctuating sexual selection on male behaviour and ornamentation in guppies. We used shade cloth and filters to experimentally manipulate light spectrum, mimicking conditions found naturally: early morning/late afternoon light ({SC} treatment), midday forest shade (F89 filter treatment) and midday woodland shade (F55 filter treatment). Females were more responsive to male courtship and males were less likely to attempt sneak copulations under F55 light than the other two treatments. By contrast, male display rate was not influenced by treatment. Females tended to prefer the same males under {SC} and F55 light, but attractiveness in these treatments was unrelated to attractiveness under F89 light. There were similarities among treatments in the traits that females preferred: females preferred males with larger areas of orange in all three treatments. There were, however, also some differences, including preference for larger males under F89 light and for smaller males under the other treatments. Overall, the influence of ambient light spectrum on the relative importance of mate choice and male sneak copulation may have important implications for the mode and strength of sexual selection in different environments. The findings on attractiveness and preference functions, however, suggest that light spectrum only weakly affects the direction of sexual selection by female choice.},

Species density, abundance and composition of Hemiptera (true bugs) were assessed in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest and a chronosequence of restored bauxite mine pits near Boddington, Western Australia, in order to evaluate how restoration was progressing. A significant difference was uncovered for hemipteran species density between the youngest restored treatment and forest. In contrast, hemipteran composition was distinct between the forest and all restored treatments. Hemipteran composition was associated with the presence of the plant species Conostylis setigera and Trichocline spathulata, and plant structure between 160-180 cm and 260-280, plus soil {pH}. Restoration was successful in returning Hemiptera with respect to species density, but restoration was yet to attain a similar composition of Hemiptera to that of unmined forest, despite some of the restored sites being almost 20 years old. These results are similar to those of other studies that have assessed the response of Hemiptera to disturbance, and highlight the need to wait for considerable periods in order to achieve restoration goals. This study also confirms the utility of Hemiptera as bioindicators of environmental 'condition' and change.},

Conspicuousness arises from the contrast between the light reflected by the colour patches, and the light reflected by the visual background in ambient light used for displays. Conspicuousness also depends on the discrimination abilities of both conspecifics and predators. We investigated whether different light environments are present in temperate woodlands, and whether male Blue Tits use this variability to optimize intraspecific conspicuousness while reducing the probability of detection by predators. We measured reflectance of plumage and Visual backgrounds, irradiance of available light environments during the breeding period. We used measures of photoreceptor sensitivity of the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus and of a bird approaching that of its main predator the European sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus. We found different light environments in space and time (during the day and throughout the year) that birds could exploit and select for sexual signalling. The blue crown colour appears to be more conspicuous in early/late light environments but during the day it appears to be least conspicuous in woodland shade for both conspecifics and predators. Male Blue Tits, by displaying more intensively at dawn during the breeding period, would optimize intraspecific communication without minimizing detectability by predators. Inversely, by choosing to sing mainly in woodland shade during the day, male Blue Tits reduce the probability of visual detection by predators but also their visibility to conspecifics.},

Restoration efforts in the Great Lakes and East Coast regions of North America often consist of planting monocultures of the dominant native grass species, Ammophila breviligulata. We evaluated 18 dune restoration projects in the Great Lakes region conducted over the past 25 years. We characterized attributes of diversity (plants and insects), vegetation structure (plant biomass and cover), and ecological processes (soil nutrients and mycorrhizal fungi abundance) in each restoration, and we compared these measures to geographically paired natural dune communities. Restoration sites were similar to reference sites in most measured variables. Differences between restorations and reference sites were mostly explained by differences in ages, with the younger sites supporting slightly lower plant diversity and mycorrhizal spore abundance than older sites. Plant community composition varied little between restored and reference sites, with only one native forb species, Artemisia campestris, occurring significantly more often in reference sites than restored sites. Although it remains unclear whether more diverse restoration plantings could accelerate convergence on the ecological conditions of reference dunes, in general, traditional restoration efforts involving monoculture plantings of A. breviligulata in Great Lakes sand dunes appear to achieve ecological conditions found in reference dunes.},

	abstract = {The plumage coloration of wild birds often changes during the breeding season. One of the possible reasons for this is that sunlight, and particularly ultraviolet ({UV}) wavelengths, degrades the pigments responsible for plumage coloration. It has been suggested that birds may apply preen wax to feathers to protect feathers from bleaching. This hypothesis is tested by exposing carotenoid-based breast feathers of Great Tits to ambient light, light filtered to exclude {UV} and darkness. Preen waxes were experimentally removed from feather samples and the effect of light on coloration of treatment and control feathers compared. Ambient light had an effect on feather colour but preen wax did not. Feathers exposed to sun gradually became less saturated and hues shifted towards shorter wavelengths. This was not apparent in control feathers kept in darkness. Feathers exposed to full-spectra sunlight faded more than those that were kept in light with {UV} wavelengths removed. There was a decrease in brightness of feathers in both experimental and control groups, which was assumed to be an effect of dirt accumulation. This experiment confirmed earlier suspicions regarding the detrimental effects of {UV} irradiation on carotenoid-based coloration of avian feathers but failed to show any protective function of preen waxes. The possible consequences of these mechanisms of colour change for birds with regard to mating strategies are discussed.},

Here, we experimentally decreased the {UV} coloration of randomly chosen males from otherwise similar male pairs to test the hypothesis that a difference in {UV} colour alone can affect fight success during male-male competition. Our results fully supported the hypotheses: in almost 90 per cent of the contests the male with reduced {UV} lost the fight.

The red fody (Foudia madagascariensis) is a highly sexually dimorphic species of the family Ploceidae, in which males exhibit extensive carotenoid-based plumage. We investigated associations between body condition, clutch size, first egg date and carotenoid-based red plumage colour of male red fodies. Breast plumage brightness was positively associated with male body condition, suggesting that this component of colour is condition-dependent. Brighter-red males did not breed earlier but were mated to females that laid larger clutches compared to females mated to duller-coloured males.

Site: Cultivated alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields near Avondale, Arizona, August-September 2004. Methods: I randomly sampled 70 'pristine' males and an additional 98 males in five age classes. I then measured key reflectance characteristics (brightness, hue and chroma) of the dorsal structural ultraviolet markings and of the coincident pigmentary yellowish-orange. Conclusions: Consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis, structural reflectance parameters are more phenotypically variable. Structural reflectance also fades more with age.

	abstract = {Wide-field direction-selective neurones from the optic lobes of the butterfly Papilio aegeus show some properties similar to those displayed by the large neurones of the fly lobula plate. Temporal and spatial frequency threshold tuning curves show that butterfly optic lobe neurones sensitive to different directions of image motion are fed by presynaptic subunits similar to those of the fly. However, unlike fly lobula plate neurones, the butterfly optic lobe neurones show a steep low-spatial-frequency roll-off which persists even at high temporal frequencies. Also exceptional is the temporal resolution of rapid changes in image speed by the butterfly neurones. When the cells are adapted to continuous motion their responses indicate a further increase in temporal resolution. Evidence is provided that in any one state of adaptation the neurones may be thought of as piece-wise linear and, thus, their responses can be predicted by convolution with a velocity kernel measured for that adaptation state. Adaptation to continuous motion results in the cells responding to motion in proportion to the mean motion signal. Motion in the non-preferred direction also appears to adapt the cells. Velocity impulse responses of both butterfly and blowfly neurones were determined with one-dimensional gratings and two-dimensional textured patterns and the results for the two stimuli are shown to be very similar.},

	abstract = {Laniarius is one of the larger genera within the avian bush-shrike radiation, the family Malaconotidae. Fairly homogenous by size and shape but highly variable by colours, these have been classified mainly on basis of plumage colours. In the present study, which is the first taxon-dense analysis of the genus Laniarius based on molecular sequence data (nuclear {BRM}15 intron-15, and mitochondrial {ND}2 and {ATPase}6 genes), we investigate interrelationships between 16 species and 34 subspecies of Laniarius. Altogether 2094 bp were aligned and subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses. Results strongly support the monophyly of Laniarius, and place it close to Chlorophoneus, but without outlining a precise sister-group. In a generally well-resolved phylogeny of Laniarius, L. leucorhynchus and L. atrococcineus constitute deep branches and the remaining species form five clades which are not concordant with previously defined superspecies. The black and white boubous belong to two different clades. L. aethiopicus appears polyphyletic and our results support the resurrection of Laniarius major, Laniarius erlangeri and Laniarius sublacteus. We also find that L. liberatus, described in 1991 based on the only known live individual, is identified as an unusual colour morph from L. erlangeri. The black boubous are not monophyletic; L. funebris and L. leucorhynchus appear as isolated species whereas L. poensis and L. fuellebormi are sister-taxa. We recovered the polyphyly of crimson boubous and new hypotheses on their relationships have been generated. Overall, the variation in pigments and patterns does not follow phylogenetic lineages. The plumage coloration could be thoroughly subject to modification and it could not reflect exactly colour plumages of the parents. From then on, the plumage coloration appears as an unreliable morphological character for defining species and species groups. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Ixodiphagus hookeri is a parasitic wasp of ixodid ticks around the world. It has been studied as a potential bio-control agent for several tick species. We suspected that the presence of Wolbachia infected I. hookeri eggs in ticks is responsible for incidental detection of Wolbachia {DNA} in tick samples. Methods: The 28S {rRNA} and 16S {rRNA} genes of a specimen of I. hookeri was amplified and sequenced. {PCR} on part of the 28S {rRNA} gene was used to detect parasitic wasp {DNA} in 349 questing Ixodes ricinus ticks from various sampling sites. Furthermore, the wsp gene of Wolbachia was sequenced from the I. hookeri specimen and a subset of ticks was tested using this marker. Results: Several sequences from tick specimens were identical to the Wolbachia sequence of the I. hookeri specimen. Ixodiphagus hookeri was detected in 9.5\% of all tested ticks, varying between 4\% and 26\% depending on geographic location. Ten out of eleven sampling sites throughout the Netherlands were positive for I. hookeri. Eighty-seven percent of I. hookeri-positive but only 1.6\% of I. hookeri-negative ticks were Wolbachia positive. Detection of I. hookeri {DNA} was strongly associated with the detection of Wolbachia in ticks. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of I. hookeri in the Netherlands. Furthermore I. hookeri harbours Wolbachia species and is broadly distributed in the Netherlands. While detection of Wolbachia {DNA} in ticks might often be due to parasitism with this wasp, other sources of Wolbachia {DNA} in ticks might exist as well.},

	abstract = {Bird plumage is coloured both by pigments and by spectrally selective interference in the light reflected from feather barbs. These barbs are composites of high- and low-refractive-index materials, and light is reflected at refractive index boundaries. The spatial structure determines the wavelengths where constructive interference occurs and, hence, the spectral tuning. The spectral tuning of interference colours often varies with angles of illumination and reflection, which produces iridescence. Iridescence and other optical effects mean that interference coloration looks different from pigmentation and is visually striking. To study the optical and visual properties of structural plumage colours, we recorded the reflectance spectra of feathers and in particular their directional properties. A fixed spot on a feather was viewed from a fixed position, whilst the feather orientation and the angle of illumination were varied. We recognise two main types of coloration, `directional' and `diffuse'. Within these types, there is considerable variation, and five examples illustrate some features of structural plumage colours and suggest how their optical and visual properties can be measured and described.},

	abstract = {Honeybees’ plasticity to adjust responses according to environmental changes has been extensively studied in the laboratory but seldom along temporal variation in natural resources. Apple (Malus domesticus) and pear (Pyrus communis) trees often coexist in mixed agricultural settings offering different resources, and their blooming periods are slightly shifted. This scenario provides an opportunity to study how changing environments influence the way the honeybees perceive, learn, discriminate, and use odor-resource information along successive flowering events. We found that honeybees preferred to gather pollen on pear flowers and nectar on apple. These individual preferences correlated with variations in the type of resources collected at the colony level according to changes in the floral market. Spontaneous proboscis extension response to pear and apple floral scents of bees captured at the hives located within the crops fluctuated according to changes in floral availability too. The capability of the proboscis extension response-trained honeybees to discriminate between both floral scents at the beginning or at the end of the flowering period was also found, although bees lose this ability when both flowers were fully available. These response patterns suggest that olfactory information experienced on flowers were memorized to predict reward yet susceptible of being reversed when the floral scents were no longer available in the orchard. Combining behavioral assays and field observations, we provide here an example of how honeybees process floral odor information to make decisions about resources in a fluctuating complex environment.},

Wolbachia commonly act as reproductive parasites in arthropods by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), a type of conditional sterility between hosts harboring incompatible infections. In this study, we examined the evolutionary histories of Wolbachia infections, known as {wPip}, in the common house mosquito Culex pipiens, which exhibits the greatest variation in {CI} crossing patterns observed in any insect. We first investigated a panel of 20 {wPip} strains for their genetic diversity through a multilocus scheme combining 13 Wolbachia genes. Because Wolbachia depend primarily on maternal transmission for spreading within arthropod populations, we also studied the variability in the coinherited Cx. pipiens mitochondria. In total, we identified 14 {wPip} haplotypes, which all share a monophyletic origin and clearly cluster into five distinct {wPip} groups. The diversity of Cx. pipiens mitochondria was extremely reduced, which is likely a consequence of cytoplasmic hitchhiking driven by a unique and recent Wolbachia invasion. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that {wPip} infections and mitochondrial {DNA} have codiverged through stable cotransmission within the cytoplasm and shows that a rapid diversification of {wPip} has occurred. The observed pattern demonstrates that a considerable degree of Wolbachia diversity can evolve within a single host species over short evolutionary periods. In addition, multiple signatures of recombination were found in most {wPip} genomic regions, leading us to conclude that the mosaic nature of {wPip} genomes may play a key role in their evolution.},

To date, the great majority of studies are of Northern Hemisphere taxa, and reflect the influence of vicariant events during, or prior to, the Pleistocene. Microsatellite markers and mitochondrial {DNA} sequences were used to investigate patterns of population divergence and evolutionary relationships in a freshwater group of silverside fishes (Odontesthes perugiae complex), endemic to the recently formed coastal plain of southern Brazil. Lacustrine morphotypes showed concordant patterns of genetic and morphological divergence consistent with the geographical history of the coastal plain. The results support the proposal of a silverside radiation chronologically shaped by the sea-level changes of the Pleistocene and Holocene. The radiating lineage comprises a minimum of three allopatric and two sympatric lacustrine species. Four species displayed extremely high levels of genetic variation and some of the most rapid speciation rates reported in fishes. These features were related to a marine-estuarine origin of the radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first molecular phylogeographic survey of a coastal radiation in South America.},

For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by-product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.},

	abstract = {Males typically have greater variance in reproductive success than females, so mothers should benefit by producing sons under favourable conditions. Being paired with a better-than-average mate is one such favourable circumstance. High-quality fathers can improve conditions for their offspring by providing good genes, good resources, or both, so females paired to such males should invest preferentially in sons. Ornamentation has been linked to male quality in many birds, and, in support of differential allocation theory, females of several avian species invest more in entire broods when paired to attractive mates. Additionally, the females of some bird species apparently manipulate the primary sex ratio of their broods in relation to the attractiveness of their mates. However, empirical support for a link between mate ornamentation and preferential feeding of sons (another form of biased investment) is lacking. We tested for correlations between sex-biased parental investment and mate plumage colour in the eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis, a species in which juveniles have sexually dichromatic {UV} blue plumage. We found that the proportion of maternal feeding attempts to fledgling sons (versus fledgling daughters) was positively correlated with structurally coloured plumage ornamentation of fathers. Additionally, paternal feeding attempts to sons were correlated with plumage ornamentation of mothers and increased in fathers that had breast plumage characteristics typical of older males. These results provide further support for the idea that parental strategies are influenced by mate attractiveness and provide the first evidence that mate ornamentation can influence parental behaviour even after offspring have left the nest.

Our study focuses on the effect of {UV} reflectance on female preference; we hypothesize that common kestrel females prefer males with {UV}-reflecting plumage and refuse, or are not attracted to, males whose plumage {UV} reflectance is prevented. We tested the preference of 20 captive females who were given a choice between two males, one behind a {UV}-transmitting ({UV}+) filter and another one behind a {UV}-blocking ({UV}-) filter. Female preference was measured as frequency and duration of visits to either male, specifically by sitting on the perch or hanging on to the partition wall. Females visited the male behind the {UV}+ filter more often than the male behind the {UV}- filter, indicating that females prefer males with {UV}-reflecting plumage than males without {UV} reflection. {UV} plumage and skin reflectance could provide females with information regarding current male conditions more so than other colours and other morphological parameters.},

This simple and cost-effective method provides precise and repeatable quantification of color and shape that discriminated subtle differences in egg crypsis of artificial and natural nests that were not visible to us. The advantages of digital photography and image-editing software outweigh any shortcomings, as long as standard protocols are followed for capturing and analyzing images.

	abstract = {1. Persistent pesticide residues remain a significant environmental pollutant, reducing breeding success of predatory birds even where such pesticides have been banned for many years. The ability to detect such residues inexpensively without destructive sampling would be a valuable tool for ecotoxicological monitoring. We suggest that assaying eggshell colour might provide such a tool. 2. Recent studies have revealed two mechanisms affecting eggshell pigmentation in, and believed to be specific to, passerine birds. In the great tit Parus major, reddish protoporphyrin speckles on their otherwise white eggs coincide precisely with thin shell and are related to calcium shortage. In the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, the intensity of the eggshell's blue-green ground-colour (pigment biliverdin) is related to the female's health (immunocompetence) at laying. We studied the effect of the insecticide {DDT} (notorious for reducing eggshell thickness in raptors by blocking calcium availability to the shell gland) on the eggshell pigmentation of Eurasian sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Falconiformes), whose eggshells show both protoporphyrin spotting and a blue-green biliverdin-based ground colour. 3. Eggshells showing protoporphyrin spots as an internalized pigment layer also showed a strong correlation between {DDE} levels ({DDT} metabolite) and shell thickness. The shells were also significantly thinner at these spots. Eggshell thickness was uncorrelated with {DDE} levels in eggs that lacked such spotting. 4. The green-ness of the ground colour, related to biliverdin pigment, also increased with {DDE} levels but, unlike the protoporphyrins, this increase was independent of eggshell thickness. 5. We also noted that the colour of eggs collected before 1930 was consistent with the environmental absence of {DDT}. 6. Synthesis and applications. {DDT} occurrence in predatory birds indicates ecosystem-wide contamination. Correlation between eggshell colour and {DDT} concentration indicates that pigmentation might be used as a non-destructive assay for {DDT} (which is still in widespread use, particularly for combating malaria) in eggs. Further studies should allow our findings to be applied to other raptor species. Our results corroborate the associations of protoporphyrin pigmentation with shell thinning and biliverdin with female immunocompetence described for passerines, but their occurrence in a falconiform implies that these effects evolved long before the appearance of the order Passeriformes.},

In some cases, developmental cues can be used to match phenotype to environment—a strategy known as predictive plasticity. When environmental conditions are entirely unpredictable, generating random phenotypic diversity may improve the long-term success of a lineage—a strategy known as diversified bet hedging. When partially reliable information is available, a well-adapted developmental strategy may strike a balance between the two strategies. We use information theory to analyze a model of development in an uncertain environment, where cue reliability is affected by variation both within and between generations. We show that within-generation variation in cues decreases the reliability of cues without affecting their fitness value. This transpires because the optimal balance of predictive plasticity and diversified bet hedging is unchanged. However, within-generation variation in cues does change the developmental mechanisms used to create that balance: developmental sensitivity to such cues not only helps match phenotype to environment but also creates phenotypic diversity that may be useful for hedging bets against environmental change. Understanding the adaptive role of developmental sensitivity thus depends on a proper assessment of both the predictive power and the structure of variation in environmental cues.},

	abstract = {The colourful appearance of avian eggshells is a prominent aspect of maternal reproductive effort in birds. Some differences in eggshell coloration have been reported to co-vary with various measures of maternal condition and these patterns support the hypothesis that, in some bird species, several aspects of eggshell colour (i.e. primary chroma and brightness) function as a signal of maternal and offspring quality to induce greater paternal investment. We directly quantified eggshell pigment concentrations of blackbird Turdus merula and song thrush T. philomelos eggshells and tested how the two key pigments (protoporphyrin {IX} and biliverdin) co-varied with other eggshell traits and egg constituents as measures of maternal reproductive investment, including total yolk carotenoid concentration, total lipid concentration, yolk mass, and shell thickness. Contrary to predictions, we detected few statistical patterns overall. We found that protoporphyrin {IX} concentration was negatively associated with blue-green chroma in blackbirds but not in song thrush. The concentration of protoporphyrin {IX} was significantly greater in blackbirds and also showed different patterns of association with total yolk lipids and yolk carotenoid concentrations between these two species (significant species interaction terms). Our results reveal that it is not appropriate to simply assume in these two avian species that reflectance-based eggshell colour measures are a suitable proxy for eggshell pigment concentrations or can be used as consistent predictors of maternal reproductive investment. These results highlight the need to assess and validate the strength and direction of the statistical relationships between eggshell colour measures, pigment concentrations, and maternal resource deposition in the egg for other species of birds.},

Receiving mechanisms probably evolve to increase the efficiency and reliability of information reception whereas signals probably evolve to increase the efficiency of communication and reliability of manipulation of the receiving individual to the benefit of the emitter. The minimum requirement for clear reception suggests that any study of the evolution and design of communication systems must consider the factors that affect the quality of the received and processed signal. Critical information is needed about how the signal is generated and emitted, how it fares during transmission through air, water or substrate, how it is received and processed by the receiver's sensory and cognitive systems, and the factors which affect the fitness consequences of alternative ways of reacting to the information contained in the signal. These should allow predictions about the kinds and forms of signals used by animals signalling under known conditions. Phylogenetic history, and the geological time a clade spends in different signalling environments, will also affect signal evolution, and hence the success of predictions about signal design. We need to use methods of many different biological fields to understand the design and evolution of signals and signalling systems.},

These signals, which may evolve via sexual and/or social selection, mediate intra-specific competition by influencing the outcome or escalation of contests between individuals. The last 10 years saw the rise of interest in the role of ultraviolet ({UV})-based coloration in intra-sexual communication. However, the rare experimental studies that tested this hypothesis found opposite results, which may originate from the different methodological procedures used to assess the badge of status theory. We present here the results of an experiment testing whether male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) respond differently to unfamiliar conspecifics presenting contrasted {UV} crest coloration. In an aviary, we simultaneously presented two caged blue tits with enhanced ({UV}+) or reduced ({UV}-) crest coloration to a focal bird. We found that focal males acted more aggressively towards the {UV}- males than {UV}+ males. In addition, focal males fed more often close to males that were similar in brightness or duller than themselves. We conclude that, in blue tits, {UV} blue crest coloration affects both social and aggressive responses towards unfamiliar individuals, and thus it has some properties of a badge of status.},

We analysed nuptial colour variation within and among nine populations of southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis Gunther) along an environmental light gradient. Within populations, larger males were redder and blacker, and better-condition males were blacker. Among populations, red colour was positively correlated with the amount of orange-red light present, suggesting that males are likely optimizing signal conspicuousness by producing proportionally larger and redder patches in broad spectrum environments with more orange-red light. Signal contrast, in this regard, is maximized when red colour, appearing bright because of the prevalence of red wavelengths, is viewed against the water-column background. Together, our results are concordant with the sensory drive hypothesis; selection favours signal adaptations or signal plasticity to ensure communication efficacy is maximized in different light environments.},

Therefore, to understand the mechanics and evolution of bio-optical tissues it is critical to understand their material properties, both in isolation and in combination. Here, we review the optics and evolution of coloured tissues with a focus on their base materials, using birds and butterflies as exemplar taxa owing to the strength of our current knowledge of colour production in these animals. We first review what is known of their base materials, and then discuss the consequences of these interactions from an optical perspective.

	abstract = {Wolbachia is a widespread group of intracellular bacteria commonly found in arthropods. In many insect species, Wolbachia induce a cytoplasmic mating incompatibility ({CI}). If different Wolbachia infections occur in the same host species, bidirectional Cl is often induced. Bidirectional Cl acts as a postzygotic isolation mechanism if parapatric host populations are infected with different Wolbachia strains. Therefore, it has been suggested that Wolbachia could promote speciation in their hosts. In this article we investigate theoretically whether Wolbachia-induced bidirectional Cl selects for premating isolation and therefore reinforces genetic divergence between parapatric host populations. To achieve this we combined models for Wolbachia dynamics with a well-studied reinforcement model. This new model allows us to compare the effect of bidirectional Cl on the evolution of female mating preferences with a situation in which postzygotic isolation is caused by nuclear genetic incompatibilities ({NI}). We distinguish between nuclear incompatibilities caused by two loci with epistatic interactions, and a single locus with incompatibility among heterozygotes in the diploid phase. Our main findings are: (1) bidirectional Cl and single locus {NI} select for premating isolation with a higher speed and for a wider parameter range than epistatic {NI}; (2) under certain parameter values, runaway sexual selection leads to the increase of an introduced female preference allele and fixation of its preferred male trait allele in both populations, whereas under others it leads to divergence in the two populations in preference and trait alleles; and (3) bidirectional Cl and single locus {NI} can stably persist up to migration rates that are two times higher than seen for epistatic {NI}. The latter finding is important because the speed with which mutants at the preference locus spread increases exponentially with the migration rate. In summary, our results show that bidirectional Cl selects for rapid premating isolation and so generally support the view that Wolbachia can promote speciation in their hosts.},

	abstract = {Cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) in Drosophila simulans is related to infection of the germ line by a rickettsial endosymbiont (genus Wolbachia). Wolbachia were transferred by microinjection of egg cytoplasm into uninfected eggs of both D. simulans and D. melanogaster to generate infected populations. Transinfected strains of D. melanogaster with lower densities of Wolbachia than the naturally infected D. simulans strain did not express high levels of {CI}. However, transinfected D. melanogaster egg cytoplasm, transferred back into D. simulans, generated infected populations that expressed {CI} at levels near those of the naturally infected strain. A transinfected D. melanogaster line selected for increased levels of {CI} expression also displayed increased symbiont densities. These data suggest that a threshold level of infection is required for normal expression of {CI} and that host factors help determine the density of the symbiont in the host.},

	abstract = {Countershading, a vertical luminance gradient from a dark back to a light belly, is perhaps the most common coloration phenotype in the animal kingdom. Why? We investigated whether countershading functions as self-shadow concealment ({SSC}) in ruminants. We calculated "optimal" countershading for {SSC} by measuring illumination falling onto a model ruminant as a function of time of day and lighting environment. Calibrated images of 114 species of ruminant were compared to the countershading model, and phylogenetic analyses were used to find the best predictors of coats' countershading characteristics. In many species, countershading was close to the model's prediction of "optimal" countershading for {SSC}. Stronger countershading was associated with increased use of open lighting environments, living closer to the equator, and small body size. Abrupt transitions from dark to light tones were more common in open lighting environments but unassociated with group size or antipredator behavior. Though the {SSC} hypothesis prediction for stronger countershading in diurnal species was not supported and noncountershaded or reverse-countershaded species were unexpectedly common, this basic pattern of associations is explained only by the {SSC} hypothesis. Despite extreme variation in lighting conditions, many terrestrial animals still find protection from predation by compensating for their own shadows.},

Previously, the two species were found in separate agricultural habitats in Israel. Here, additional collections were undertaken and mixed populations of the two species were found. Manipulation experiments were conducted in order to test whether sexual interactions occur when T. turkestani and T. urticae {RF} share the same host. Interspecific crosses showed that the two species are capable of producing viable F(1) females, but that these females are sterile as their F(2) eggs failed to hatch. This indicates a post-zygotic reproductive barrier, supporting the current placement of T. turkestani as a separate taxon. Mating behavior parameters revealed that males of both species courted virgin conspecific and heterospecific females at the same rate and readily tried to copulate with them. Female mate recognition seemed to be more reliable in T. turkestani than in T. urticae {RF} as the number of copulations was significantly higher and their duration significantly shorter in the T. turkestani interspecific (T. turkestani a ({TM}) Euro x T. urticae {RF} a ({TM}),) as compared to the intraspecific crosses, a phenomenon not observed in T. urticae {RF}. In mixed cultures, a significant reduction in female production was observed for T. urticae {RF} but not for T. turkestani, suggesting an asymmetric reproductive interference effect in favor of T. turkestani. The long term outcome of this effect is yet to be determined since additional reproductive factors such as oviposition rate and progeny survival to adulthood may reduce the probability of demographic displacement of one species by the other in overlapping niches.},

	abstract = {Many animals deceive prey by presenting a deceptive signal that lures prey into close proximity. These predators are predicted to select habitats that maximize the efficacy of their deceptive signal and offer high levels of prey traffic. The orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus preys upon pollinators that are deceived by the predator’s resemblance to a flower. Habitat patches that contain flowers can offer orchid mantises high levels of insect activity, yet may be detrimental to the success of their deceptive signaling strategy. Currently 2 exclusive hypotheses—previously applied to deceptive flowers—predict the interaction between signaling efficacy under different flower densities. Increased competition for pollinators from nearby flowers suggests that orchid mantis signals should be more effective when in isolation from flowers (remote habitats hypothesis). Alternatively, orchid mantises may benefit from increased insect activity when near flowers (magnet species hypothesis). We found that orchid mantises had no preference for inhabiting flowers over leafy vegetation. They were also no more effective in attracting prey when sitting upon flowers compared to when in isolation from flowers. However, field experiments revealed that the density of flowers in their immediate vicinity did have an effect on orchid mantis attractiveness. Mantises were visited by more flying insects when in patches of high flower density, suggesting that they benefit from the magnet species effect. Co-occurring flowers do not negatively impact the efficacy of the orchid mantis’ deceptive signal and areas with high densities of flowers may allow them access to high levels of prey availability.},

The direct means by which the most colorful males achieve superior health has been debated, however. One hypothesis, based on studies of carotenoids as antioxidants in humans and other animals, is that carotenoids directly boost the immune system of colorful birds. We studied the relationship between carotenoid pigments, immune function, and sexual coloration in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which males incorporate carotenoid pigments into their beak to attract mates. We tested the hypotheses that increased dietary carotenoid intake enhances immunocompetence in male zebra finches and that levels of carotenoids circulating in blood, which also determine beak coloration, directly predict the immune response of individuals. We experimentally supplemented captive finches with two common dietary carotenoid pigments (lutein and zeaxanthin) and measured cell-mediated and humoral immunity a month later. Supplemented males showed elevated blood-carotenoid levels, brighter beak coloration, and increased cell-mediated and humoral immune responses than did controls. Cell-mediated responses were predicted directly by changes in beak color and plasma carotenoid concentration of individual birds. These experimental findings suggest that carotenoid-based color signals in birds may directly signal male health via the immunostimulatory action of ingested and circulated carotenoid pigments.},

Today, the use of reflection spectrophotometry is the most commonly used technique to study plumage coloration. A major advantage of this method is the opportunity of observing reflection beyond the human colour vision range-including the {UV}-waveband. Traditional taxonomic and phylogenetic research is often based on bird skins held in collections in natural history museums worldwide. Different agents for preservation have been used to prevent skins from being damaged by arthropod pests. Sometimes, parts of the plumage have been contaminated with stains from preservation agents. When dried, they are almost invisible to the human eye under normal sunlight conditions and cause no obvious change to feather coloration. However, some preservation agents contain fluorescent components which show up brightly when illuminated with {UV}-light. Furthermore, undetectable to the human eye, stains from these agents annihilate {UV}-reflection, preventing accurate data collection based on the {UV}-reflection of bird feathers. Measuring plumage parts which have been accidentally stained will lead to a relative underestimate of {UV}-reflection. In studying 20,000 samples, we found fluorescent stains in some 300 bird skins of varying ages (1913-2004) in museum collections throughout Europe and the {USA}. Different preservation agents have been evaluated for their fluorescence properties.},

They are produced by at least four non-carotenoid-based pigments (linear polyenal structure). In the present study, we investigated a collection of red abdominal feathers of a marked population of wild Burrowing Parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus in Patagonia, Argentina. The aims of this study were to investigate the ecological significance of the recently described non-carotenoid-based red pigments of Psittaciformes, and the relationships between objectively assessed plumage color and body size, body condition, breeding success and nestling growth in wild Psittaciformes. We found that sexes differed in plumage coloration (sexual dichromatism), that plumage color was a good predictor of female body condition and male size, and we identified the red coloration of the abdominal patch as a signal of individual quality and parental investment.},

Other modifications seen in the abnormal specimen include firstly, a distal expansion of a uniformly brown region, that otherwise occupies a proximal position on the hind wings of the wild type, and secondly, the lack of a characteristic orange cross-vein band that runs proximal to the parafocal eyespot elements on the hind wing. The differences in coloration between abnormal and wild type are seen as evidence of a proximal-distal developmental axis (originally proposed by Nijhout 1991) and support a view recently aired by Beldade and Brakefield (2003).

Cross-sectional analyses at the population level showed that older males are in general greener and more saturated in colour than yearling individuals. Longitudinal analyses using birds captured in subsequent seasons confirmed within-individual changes in coloration with age. Such increase in coloration might be the result of the development of better foraging skills with age- and hence, the individual ability to obtain enough carotenoid-rich sources at the time of moult-, or consequence of other factors indirectly associated with age. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors (such as directional selection against less coloured individuals) operate additionally at the population level.},

	abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are among the most common endosymbionts in the world. In many insect species these bacteria induce a sperm-egg incompatibility between the gametes of infected males and uninfected females, commonly called unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}). It is generally believed that unidirectional {CI} cannot promote speciation in hosts because infection differences between populations will be unstable and subsequent gene flow will eliminate genetic differences between diverging populations. In the present study we investigate this question theoretically in a mainland-island model with migration from mainland to island. Our analysis shows that (a) the infection polymorphism is stable below a critical migration rate, (b) an (initially) uninfected "island'' can better maintain divergence at a selected locus (e.g. can adapt locally) in the presence of {CI}, and (c) unidirectional {CI} selects for premating isolation in (initially) uninfected island populations if they receive migration from a Wolbachia-infected mainland. Interestingly, premating isolation is most likely to evolve if levels of incompatibility are intermediate and if either the infection causes fecundity reductions or Wolbachia transmission is incomplete. This is because under these circumstances an infection pattern with an infected mainland and a mostly uninfected island can persist in the face of comparably high migration. We present analytical results for all three findings: (a) a lower estimation of the critical migration rate in the presence of local adaptation, (b) an analytical approximation for the gene flow reduction caused by unidirectional {CI}, and (c) a heuristic formula describing the invasion success of mutants at a mate preference locus. These findings generally suggest that Wolbachia-induced unidirectional {CI} can be a factor in divergence and speciation of hosts.},

	abstract = {Species are defined using a variety of different operational techniques. Mile discussion of the various methodologies has previously been restricted mostly to taxonomists, the demarcation of species is also crucial for conservation biology. Unfortunately, different methods of diagnosing species can arrive at different entities. Most prominently, it is widely thought that use of a phylogenetic species concept may lead to recognition of afar greater number of much less inclusive units. As a result, studies of the same group of organisms can produce not only different species identities but also different species range and number of individuals. To assess the impact of different definitions on conservation issues, we collected instances from the literature where a group of organisms was categorized both under phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic concepts. Our results show a marked difference, with surveys based on a phylogenetic species concept showing more species (48\%) and an associated decrease in population size and range. We discuss the serious consequences of this trend for conservation, including an apparent change in the number of endangered species, potential political fallout, and the difficulty of deciding what should be conserved.},

	abstract = {The ability to change body coloration is widely used in the context of visual camouflage to hide from predators or prey. Although experimental evidence from human vision shows that background and prey eye colours may trigger adaptive colour change in crab spiders, no study has addressed this hypothesis in the perceptual colour space of either predator or prey. I simultaneously tested the effects of reflected light and prey eye colours on background matching of female crab spiders, Misumena vatia. Using spectroradiometric measurements and modelling of perceptual colour space of the most frequent prey, I tested whether individual spiders were able to match white and yellow light reflected by artificial backgrounds when fed either white- or red-eyed fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The colour of light reflected by the visual background triggered adaptive camouflage as seen by Hymenopteran prey. In addition, there was a significant effect of prey eye colour within each light colour experiment, with spiders fed white-eyed flies better matching light reflected by the white background, and spiders fed red-eyed flies better matching the yellow reflected light. However, only spiders exposed to yellow reflected light and fed red-eyed flies could approach the colour detection threshold calculated for Hymenoptera. These results provide insights into how colour change is triggered in crab spiders, and indicate that ommochrome pigments ingested with prey eyes not only are used by crab spiders to adjust their adaptive coloration, but also may indicate the hunting ability of females to potential mates.

However, some animals use the spatial variation of colour-producing microstructures. We have studied one distinctive example of such structurally produced colour patterns, the wing of the Madagascan sunset moth, to clarify the physical rules that underlie the colour variation. It is known that the iridescent wing scale of the sunset moth has the alternate air-cuticle multilayer structure that causes optical interference. The microscopic and optical investigations of various parts of the wing have confirmed that the thickness of the cuticle layers within the scale largely varies to produce the colour pattern. However, it varies in very different ways between the dorsal and ventral sides of the hind wing; the thickness gradually varies on the dorsal side from scale to scale, while the abrupt changes are found on the ventral side to form distinctive borders between differently coloured areas. It is also revealed that an unusual coloration mechanism is involved in the green part of the ventral hind wing: the colour is caused by higher order optical interference of the highly non-ideal multilayer structure. The physical mechanism of the colour pattern formation is briefly discussed with the several mathematical models proposed so far.},

Here I use a model of avian visual perception and scanning electron microscope imaging of feathers to show that part of variation in the size and colour properties of a melanin-based plumage signal of quality, the black breast stripe of great tits Parus major, is explained by three elements of feather microstructure (barbule density, barb cortex size and barb pith size). The strongest associations were between large stripes and low barbule density, between dark stripes and high barbule density, and between stripes with high relative long reflectance and high barbule density and thin barb cortex. By contrast, carotenoid-based colour was not related to microstructural elements. Thus, it is possible that not all variation in melanin-based colour is determined by melanin content, but also by feather microstructure. These findings should be considered by studies on the evolution of signals of quality.},

Initial contact is made by the female flying to the male's territory and attempting to feed; she may have previously visited several other territories in order to evaluate territory quality. The well-known dive display is an aggressive maneuver by the male, although it may play a role very early in the courtship sequence. Following a lengthy chase towards the female's nesting area, she alights low in dense vegetation. The male then gives the displays most critical for courtship: a back-and-forth "shuttle" display and high-intensity song. These hitherto undescribed displays occur immediately preceding copulation, and are probably the most important isolating mechanisms for the species. Many of the elements of courtship in C. anna are widespread in hummingbirds. Practice and probably learning play a major role in the maturation of song and dive displays in the individual. The courtship sequence in this hummingbird probably represents the resultant of various selective pressures, some acting mainly on males and others on females.},

	abstract = {High-speed filming has been used to investigate the performance of the peacock butterfly Inachis io while flying in a wind-tunnel. The wake of the butterfly in ‘feeding’ flight is a system of discrete pairs of vortex rings: in each pair the vortex rings are coupled at right angles. The flow distribution around the butterfly and the dynamics of the vortex rings suggest that useful force is produced continuously throughout the wingbeat. The butterfly's flapping flight can be divided into three successive stages: during the downstroke, force generation can be explained by quasi-steady aerofoil action; during the upstroke and supination, by unsteady aerofoil action; and during pronation, by a jet mechanism.The study of airflow around the peacock butterfly throws light on the evolutionary changes in the pattern of interaction between insect wings and the air. At the first stage of the evolution of insect flight, documented in a subimago of the mayfly Heptagenia sulphurea and some other primitive insects, flapping wings generate a system of coupled vortex rings; the aerodynamic force, being perpendicular to the stroke plane, coincides with the direction of the longitudinal body axis. At the second stage, this force is directed forwards and upwards relative to the body axis; the vortex wake is the same as that at the first stage. From this point, two paths of evolution are possible. The first leads to the vortex pattern recorded in the peacock butterfly. The second is typically found in higher orders, where the narrow and relatively short wings flap with lower amplitude and higher frequency, leaving in their wake two chains of uncoupled small vortex rings.},

	abstract = {The colors of fruits and flowers are traditionally viewed as an adaptation to increase the detectability of plant organs to animal vectors. The detectability of visual signals increases with increasing contrasts between target and background. Contrasts consist of a chromatic aspect (color) and an achromatic aspect (light intensity), which are perceived separately by animals. To evaluate the relative importance of fruits' chromatic and achromatic contrasts for the detection by avian fruit consumers we conducted an experiment with artificial fruits of four different colors in a tropical forest. We displayed the fruits against two different backgrounds, an artificial background and a natural one, because they differed in achromatic properties. We found no effect of the type of background on fruit detection rates. Detection rates differed for the four fruit colors. The probability of detection was explained by the chromatic contrast between fruits and their background, not by the achromatic contrasts. We suggest that birds attend primarily to chromatic contrast probably because these are more reliably detected under variable light conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found habitat-specific differences in the conspicuousness of natural fruit colors in the study area. Fruits of understory species that are subjected to the variable light conditions within a forest displayed higher chromatic contrasts than species growing in the open restinga forest with constant bright illumination. There was no such difference for achromatic contrasts. In sum, we suggest that fruit colors differ between habitats because fruit colors that have strong chromatic contrasts against background can increase plants' reproductive success, particularly under variable light conditions.},

However, the relative abilities of these different color-scoring procedures to capture variation in the actual color-generating mechanisms-pigment or structural composition of the integument-have never been tested systematically. Here, we examined which commonly employed color metrics predict carotenoid content of ornaments in three avian species (house finch Carpodacus mexicanus, mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos, and zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata). We used spectrophotometry to measure reflectance spectra from beak and feather tissue, calculated numerous color metrics (e.g., hue, chroma, brightness, principal components, and tetrahedral color space position) from these spectra, and determined carotenoid content at the site of color measurement with high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that several principal component, tristimulus, and avian visual model metrics significantly correlated with carotenoid content of house finch feathers and duck beaks. Carotenoid content of mallard beaks was most closely correlated with brightness and saturation metrics, whereas in house finch feathers, carotenoid concentration was best captured by hue and saturation metrics. According to tristimulus scores and visual models, we found that the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum was not an essential predictor of variation in carotenoid content. Also, visual model chromatic contrasts generally were not significant predictors of carotenoid content, although some achromatic contrasts and tetrahedral color space vector parameters were. Our results indicate that numerous methods, especially tristimulus scores, are suitable for capturing pigment-based color variation in two carotenoid-containing ornaments, and we discuss the merits and shortcomings of these different approaches. In contrast, there were no significant relationships between any color metrics and the carotenoid content of zebra finch beaks, suggesting that other color-generating mechanisms besides carotenoids may contribute to color variability in this species.},

Recently, it has been shown that testosterone increases the amount of circulating carotenoids in birds. Here, a testosterone-mediated trade-off in the carotenoid allocation between colour expression and the fight against oxidative stress is proposed. Male red-legged partridges were treated with testosterone, anti-androgens or manipulated as controls. Testosterone-treated males maintained the highest circulating carotenoid levels, but showed the palest red traits and no evidence of oxidative damage. Increased levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (i.e. glutathione) indicated that an oxidative challenge was in fact induced but controlled. The trade-off was apparently solved by reducing redness, allowing increased carotenoid availability, which could have contributed to buffer oxidative stress.},

Detecting female mate choice based on visual cues is notoriously hard in lizards.

Here, we investigated if different components of nuptial throat colour of male European green lizards were correlated to other fitness-related traits, and thus could signal male quality. We found that (1) high {UV} chroma correlates positively with directional asymmetry and shows a negative trend with body condition; (2) blue chroma is not related to any individual traits; and (3) total throat brightness correlates positively with body size and relative head size, and negatively with ectoparasite load. Our results suggest that having high throat {UV} reflectance is costly for male European green lizards, so probably only high-quality individuals can afford it, while total brightness of the throat colour signals age, relative head size and health status. Hence, throat colour in male European green lizards is a multiple honest signal.},

	abstract = {Here we examine the ability of butterflies to learn colour cues in two different behavioural contexts, nectar foraging and oviposition, more or less simultaneously. We first trained female Battus philenor (Papilionidae) butterflies to associate a given colour with the presence of host plant leaf extract and assayed their colour preference; we then trained a subset of these butterflies to associate a second colour with the presence of sucrose solution and assayed colour preference once more. When offered an array of four unscented and unrewarding coloured models, 'single-trained' butterflies consistently alighted most frequently on their oviposition training colour. Green-trained butterflies landed on nontrained colours only about 4\% of the time, while butterflies trained to red, yellow or blue made about 23\% of their landings on nontrained colours; of those nontrained landings, most were on green. The majority of 'dual-trained' butterflies made the greatest number of visits to both training colours in the appropriate behavioural context; that is, they probed the models of their sucrose-associated colour and alighted on the models of their oviposition-associated colour. Landings or probes on nontrained colours in one context were consistently biased towards what was learned in the alternative context, suggesting an information-processing constraint in the butterflies. This paper provides a clear demonstration that butterflies can learn in two behavioural contexts within a short span of time. A capacity for such dual conditioning presumably permits female butterflies to forage effectively for egg-laying sites and nectar resources even when those activities are intermingled in time.

	abstract = {Male structural plumage coloration and {UV} signals in particular can provide information on individual quality and influence female choice, while melanin-pigmented plumage is largely considered to be important in intrasexual competition. Many avian species demonstrate both types of plumage ornamentation that may convey different information about the signaller's quality or condition in addition to age. We examine rufous and blue plumage ornamentation across multiple body regions in relation to age, condition and reproductive performance in male western bluebirds Sialia mexicana. We demonstrate a strong positive relationship between head plumage brightness and both male age and the mass of the offspring. Older males are in better condition and display a reduced plumage patch on the back while the size of the rufous breast patch increases with increasing condition but not with age. Spectral characters from the wings and rump were not associated with any of the reproductive parameters measured. In conjunction with published evidence showing that females preferentially accept extrapair copulations from older males, these data suggest a need for experimental manipulation of plumage colour in known-aged birds to understand mate choice in this species.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Color ornaments are often viewed as products of countervailing sexual and natural selection, because more colorful, more attractive individuals may also be more conspicuous to predators. However, while evidence for such countervailing selection exists for vertebrate color ornaments (e.g., Trinidadian guppies), similar studies have yet to be reported in invertebrates. Indeed, evidence for female mate choice based on extant variation in male coloration is limited in invertebrates, and researchers have not explicitly asked whether more attractive males are also more conspicuous to predators. Here we provide evidence that more chromatic male cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) are more attractive to females but should also be more conspicuous to predators. Female P. rapae preferentially mate with more chromatic males when choosing from populations of males with naturally occurring or commensurate, experimentally induced color variation. Mathematical models of female color vision confirm that females should be able to discriminate color differences between prospective mates. Further, chromatic and luminance contrast scores from female visual system models better predicted male mating success than did measures of male color derived more directly from color spectra. Last, models of avian color vision suggest that preferred males should be more conspicuous to known avian predators.},

	abstract = {Animal social signals are important for population recognition, communication, and mate choice. Although natural selection often favours cryptic coloration, sexual selection can underlie patterns of coloration that function in inter- or intrasexual communication. We compared social signal coloration of three lizard species across a substrate colour ecotone in New Mexico. These species exhibit cryptic blanched dorsal coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands and dark coloration on the surrounding desert soils. We detected corresponding population divergence in colour used for intra- (Aspidoscelis inornata, Sceloporus undulatus) or inter- (Holbrookia maculata) sexual signalling. Although the magnitude and direction of change in coloration varied among taxa, differences in hue and chroma accounted for more variation in social coloration than for dorsal coloration. The relative conspicuousness of social signals also varied across the ecotone. We discuss the possibilities that divergent signalling colours in this system are the result of: (1) stochastic processes, (2) direct selection, and/or (3) a correlated response to natural selection on dorsal coloration.

In Brazil, however, most of the studies in restored areas have involved only vegetation changes. The present study aimed at investigating recolonization patterns of epigeic arthropods in recently restored sites of semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil. We compared the community structure of adjoining sites 5, 17, 29 and 36 months old with that at a nearby forest remnant (reference site). We also determined the most abundant species and looked for ecological indicator species of each site age. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, and their assemblages were described and compared with multi- and univariate statistical methods. Species abundance and richness equivalent to the reference site were reached at five months after planting, however species composition was very distinctive not only in relation to the reference site, but also among restored sites. Some of the main species found in this restoration stage are common in agroecosystems or cerrado vegetation. Nevertheless, there was a clear trend of arthropod fauna in restored sites moving toward the fauna in the forest remnant over time. Our results also highlighted ants and termites because of their abundance and ants because of their high value as ecological indicators of restoration age.},

The overreplicating {wMelPop} strain was recently shown to strongly inhibit the replication of dengue virus when introduced into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as well as to stimulate chronic immune up-regulation. Here we show that stable introduction of the {wMel} strain of Drosophila melanogaster into Aedes albopictus, a vector of dengue and other arboviruses, abolished the transmission capacity of dengue virus-challenged mosquitoes. Immune up-regulation was observed in the transinfected line, but at a much lower level than that previously found for transinfected Ae. aegypti. Transient infection experiments suggest that this difference is related to Ae. albopictus immunotolerance of Wolbachia, rather than to the Wolbachia strain used. This study provides an example of strong pathogen inhibition in a naturally Wolbachia-infected mosquito species, demonstrating that this inhibition is not limited to naturally naive species, and suggests that the Wolbachia strain is more important than host background for viral inhibition. Complete bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility was observed with {WT} strains infected with the naturally occurring Ae. albopictus Wolbachia, and this provides a mechanism for introducing {wMel} into natural populations of this species.},

Extinctions will be particularly concentrated around the southern limits of the species' range, such as the Italian peninsula, except mountain populations, mainly in the Alps. M. arion is a social parasite of Myrmica ants and its survival depends on the presence and abundance of two resources, i.e. (1) a specific larval foodplant and (2) a suitable Myrmica host ant. We collected data on Thymus plants distribution, Myrmica ants abundance, turf height around Myrmica nests, distance between nests and the closest thyme plant (Thymus pulegioides), and vegetation structure at 14 patches of a M. arion fragmented population occurring in the Western Italian Alps (Val Ferret: Aosta). We found that patches with the highest abundance of M. arion had significantly higher foodplant abundance. Among 407 nests belonging to nine Myrmica species, we found M. arion larvae in one Myrmica lonae and in two Myrmica sulcinodis nests. The distribution of M. sulcinodis nests showed the best spatial overlap with Thymus plants. M. sulcinodis was also significantly more abundant on pastures showing high M. arion density, and therefore offered higher adoption probabilities to develop butterfly larvae. On M. arion habitat patches, the mean turf height around Myrmica nests varied from 10.5 to 22.3 cm and best matched the habitat requirements of T. pulegioides. Thus, we suggest that extensive grazing is needed to maintain the two most important resources for M. arion. Moreover, patches where M. arion was abundant included more numerous plant species characteristic of these mountain pastures, as well as higher plant diversity (Shannon index). As a consequence, M. arion represents an umbrella species and a good indicator for the conservation status of mountain grasslands.},

On day one, pigeons had to learn to discriminate two color keys. On day two, pigeons first performed a retention test, which was followed by a reversal of the reward contingencies of the two color keys. None of the drugs altered performance in the initial acquisition of color discrimination or affected the retention of the learned color key. In contrast, all drugs impaired reversal learning by increasing trials and incorrect responses in the reversal session. Our data support the hypothesis that D2-like receptor mechanisms, like N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulations, are involved in cognitive flexibility and relearning processes, but not in initial learning of stimulus-reward association.},

	abstract = {The Florida Scrub-Jay is a monogamous cooperative breeder in which both males and females display extensive structurally based blue plumage. Juveniles of this species exhibit blue tail and wing feathers that they begin growing as nestlings, and some of these feathers are retained throughout their first year. Although the birds appear to be sexually monochromatic, we assessed whether cryptic dichromatism exists in both the magnitude and pattern of coloration in tail feathers of juvenile Florida Scrub-Jays. We then determined whether variation in plumage coloration is associated with nutritional condition during molt. Tails of juvenile male Florida Scrub-Jays exhibit a greater proportion of {UV} reflectance than those of females. Mass at age 11 days and ptilochronology of the juvenile tail feathers were used as measures of individual nutritional condition during feather growth, and the latter was found to be positively associated with {UV} chroma. These data demonstrate that Florida Scrub-Jays are sexually dichromatic and suggest that variation in plumage color may be condition dependent, although we cannot rule out alternative explanations. Juvenile plumage coloration, therefore, has the potential to function as a signal of individual quality in both males and females.},

	abstract = {Brood parasitism in birds is one of the best examples of coevolutionary interactions in vertebrates. Coevolution between hosts and parasites is assumed to occur because the parasite imposes strong selection pressures on its hosts, reducing their fitness and thereby favouring counter-adaptations (e.g. egg rejection) which, in turn, select for parasite resistance (e.g. egg mimicry). Great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius) are usually considered a brood parasite with eggs almost perfectly mimicking those of their host, the magpie (Pica pica). However, Cl. glandarius also exploits South African hosts with very different eggs, both in colour and size, while the Cl. glandarius eggs are similar to those laid in nests of European hosts. Here, we used spectrophotometric techniques for the first time to quantify mimicry of parasitic eggs for eight different host species. We found: (1) non-significant differences in appearance of Cl. glandarius eggs laid in nests of different host species, although eggs laid in South Africa and Europe differed significantly; (2) contrary to the general assumption that Cl. glandarius eggs better mimic those of the main host in Europe (R pica), Cl. glandarius eggs more closely resembled those of the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana), a potential host in which there is no evidence of recent parasitism; (3) the appearance of Cl. glandarius eggs was not significantly related to the appearance of host eggs. We discuss three possible reasons why Cl. glandarius eggs resemble eggs of some of their hosts. We suggest that colouration of Cl. glandarius eggs is an apomorphic trait, and that variation between eggs laid in South African and European host nests is due to genetic isolation among these populations and not due to variation in colouration of host eggs.

	abstract = {Arms races between avian brood parasites and their hosts often result in parasitic mimicry of host eggs, to evade rejection. Once egg mimicry has evolved, host defences could escalate in two ways: (i) hosts could improve their level of egg discrimination; and (ii) negative frequency-dependent selection could generate increased variation in egg appearance (polymorphism) among individuals. Proficiency in one defence might reduce selection on the other, while a combination of the two should enable successful rejection of parasitic eggs. We compared three highly variable host species of the Afrotropical cuckoo finch Anomalospiza imberbis, using egg rejection experiments and modelling of avian colour and pattern vision. We show that each differed in their level of polymorphism, in the visual cues they used to reject foreign eggs, and in their degree of discrimination. The most polymorphic host had the crudest discrimination, whereas the least polymorphic was most discriminating. The third species, not currently parasitized, was intermediate for both defences. A model simulating parasitic laying and host rejection behaviour based on the field experiments showed that the two host strategies result in approximately the same fitness advantage to hosts. Thus, neither strategy is superior, but rather they reflect alternative potential evolutionary trajectories.},

In the striped plateau lizard, females with larger and more saturated orange throat patches are of higher phenotypic quality, and males preferentially associate with brighter females. Here, we assess whether this female ornament conveys fitness benefits by relating female ornamentation to offspring quality. We housed groups of male and female Sceloporus virgatus in outdoor enclosures, tracked the seasonal color development of females to determine peak ornament expression, measured offspring body condition from hatching to day 180, and measured offspring sprint speed at day 180. Although we did not eliminate the possibility of assortative mating within enclosures, we controlled for these potential effects by exposing females to small groups of similarly sized males and by including maternal body size, maternal body condition, and egg mass as covariates in our statistical models. Offspring body condition was reliably predicted by female ornament size but not by ornament color intensity or saturation. Similarly, offspring sprint speed was predicted only by ornament size and not by color intensity or saturation. Females with large ornaments tended to produce offspring with higher body condition and faster offspring than did females with small ornaments. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that males may gain fitness benefits from preferentially allocating their reproductive effort toward females with larger orange patches by producing higher quality offspring. Possible mechanisms underlying such female-ornament-offspring-quality relationships are discussed.},

Although much attention has been devoted to structural coloration reflecting in {UV}, the signaling function of structural colors lacking {UV} reflectance and those that exhibit iridescence coloration are poorly documented. The train of the peacock (Pavo cristatus), a classical example of a sexually selected trait, is composed of iridescent structurally colored eyespots not reflecting in {UV}. Until today, the role played by the structural color of the eyespots in female mate choice has never been investigated using spectrometry. We measured eyespot coloration from a stationary angle (static coloration) and the change in coloration resulting from different angles (iridescent coloration). We assessed coloration with reflectance spectrometry, and we analyzed reflectance spectra using 2 methods. First, we extracted the reflectance spectra shape descriptors hue, brightness, and chroma. Second, we computed color and brightness contrasts signaled by eyespot feathers, taking peafowl color visual sensitivity into account. Iridescence was estimated by the maximal change for all parameters. Brightness was correlated with male mating success. The maximal change in color contrast was correlated with both the frequency of male visitation by females and male mating success. These results suggest that peahens can use both static and dynamic (i.e., iridescent) aspects of plumage structural coloration as signals to detect and choose their mates.},

Quantitative comparisons with melanosome shape and density in extant feathers indicate that the body was gray and dark and the face had rufous speckles. The crown was rufous, and the long limb feathers were white with distal black spangles. The evolution of melanin-based within-feather pigmentation patterns may coincide with that of elongate pennaceous feathers in the common ancestor of Maniraptora, before active powered flight.

In the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we identified a colour ornament that is under sexual selection and appears to have a heritable basis. Hence, by engaging in extra-pair copulations with highly ornamented males, females could, in theory, obtain genes for increased offspring attractiveness. Indeed, sons sired by extra-pair partners had larger ornaments, seemingly supporting the genetic benefit hypothesis. Yet, when comparing ornament size of the social and extra-pair partners, there was no difference. Hence, the observed differences most likely had an environmental basis, mediated, for example, via differential maternal investment of resources into the eggs fertilized by extra-pair and social partners. Such maternal effects may (at least partly) be mediated by egg size, which we found to be associated with mean ornament expression in sons. Our results are consistent with the idea that maternal effects can shape sexual selection by altering the genotype-phenotype relationship for ornamentation. They also caution against automatically attributing greater offspring attractiveness or viability to an extra-pair mate's superior genetic quality, as without controlling for differential maternal investment we may significantly overestimate the role of genetic benefits in the evolution of extra-pair mating behaviour.},

In the present study, we examined whether nonbreeding dorsal body coloration has diverged between sympatric species of stickleback along with changes in habitat-specific background colours. The small, limnetic species primarily occupies the pelagic zone and the large, benthic species inhabits the littoral zone. We placed benthic and limnetic sticklebacks against extremes of habitat background colours and measured their degree of background matching and colour plasticity. Benthics matched the littoral background colour more closely than did the limnetics, although there was no difference between species in their resemblance to the pelagic background colour. Benthics were able to resemble both background colours by exhibiting greater directional colour plasticity in their dorsal body coloration than limnetics, which may be an adaptive response to the greater spectral heterogeneity of the littoral zone. The present study highlights how habitat-specific spectral characteristics may shape cryptic coloration differences between stickleback species.

We trained domestic fowls, Gallus gallus domesticus, to respond by pecking or not pecking to different colours displayed on a touch-sensitive computer screen. The colours changed in response to the birds' choices, which mimicked a simple evolutionary process. Discrimination training generated response biases for the colours more distinct from the nonrewarding colour. As a result the signals evolved towards distinct coloration. The biases developed in directions towards more intense and towards less intense colour, depending on the colour of the nonrewarding stimulus. The result may be applicable to all sorts of visual signals encountered during the same kind of experiences, that is, when one signal should be avoided and another should be approached.

	abstract = {Sit-and-wait predators have evolved several traits that increase the probability of encountering prey, including lures that attract prey. Although most crab spiders (Thomisidae) are known by their ability to change colour in order to match the background, a few use a different strategy. They are {UV}-reflective, creating a colour contrast against {UV}-absorbing flowers that is attractive for pollinators. The nature of the relationship between colour contrast and foraging success is unknown, as is how spiders trade off the potential costs and benefits of strong colour contrast. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between spider colouration, foraging success and background colouration in a crab spider species known to lure pollinators via {UV} reflectance (Thomisus spectabilis). Field data revealed that spider body condition – a proxy of past foraging success – is positively related to overall colour contrast. We experimentally tested the effect of satiation and background colour on spider colour change. Throughout the experiment, spiders changed their colour contrast regardless of their food intake, suggesting that colour contrast and the {UV} component contributing to overall contrast are not caused by spider condition. Although spiders responded to different backgrounds by subtly changing their body colour, this did not result in colour matching. We believe that the observed variation in colour contrast and hence conspicuousness in the field, coupled with the spiders’ reaction to our manipulation, could be the result of plasticity in response to prey.},

	abstract = {Cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) induced by intracellular bacteria is a possible mechanism for speciation. Growing empirical evidence suggests that bacteria of the group Wolbachia may indeed act as isolating factors in recent insect speciation. Wolbachia are cytoplasmically transmitted and can cause uni-or bidirectional {CI}. We present a mainland-island model to investigate how much impact Wolbachia can have on genetic divergence between populations. In the first scenario we assume that the island population has diverged at a selected locus and ask whether genetic divergence will be maintained after introduction of migration from the mainland. In the second we explore whether divergence will originate under migration. For simplicity, the host organisms are modeled as haploid sexuals. Simulations show that if each population is initially infected with a different strain of Wolbachia, then higher levels of divergence occur at the locally selected locus than in the absence of Wolbachia. A weaker effect is seen when there is only unidirectional {CI} caused by a single strain of Wolbachia on the island. {CI} increases divergence because it reduces effective migration between mainland and island. Migrants suffer from being confronted with the wrong {CI} system and this also applies to their matrilineal descendants. Moreover, there is a strong linkage disequilibrium between host genotype and infection state, which helps to maintain Wolbachia differences between the populations in the face of migration A sex bias in migration can either increase or decrease the effect of Wolbachia on divergence. Results support the view that Wolbachia has the potential for increasing divergence between populations and thus could enhance probabilities of speciation.},

	abstract = {The Lava Heron (Butorides straita sundevalli) is a distinctively dark-plumaged heron that feeds along the rocky intertidal shoreline of the Galapagos Islands. The open shoreline used by the Lava Heron differs markedly from the dense swamps used by, most populations of Butorides Larva Herons feed by standing and by walking slowly at the water's edge, averaging only three steps per minute and catching primarily fish, crabs and prawns. Lava Heron foraging is characterized not only by, its use of open shoreline, but by an extreme dependence oil standing feeding behavior, frequent shifting of feeding sites following the tidal flux across a broad intertidal zone, and importance of crabs in the diet; but overall its foraging does not differ significantly from that used by Butorides elsewhere. The fundamental Butorides foraging strategy appears to have accommodated the habitat shift from dense bushes to open shoreline. Individuals maintain separate feeding territories, with the nest being placed within the territory of one of the pair. Feeding success was 0.12 prey per minute. In that nesting production is low contrasted with other populations, it appears that food may overall be limiting. The Galapagos population differs from South American Striated Herons (Butorides striata striata) in having a longer and stouter bill, a feature that correlates with the importance of crabs in the diet. Although known for its distinctive dark color, plumage ranges from all black to light grey, similar to South American birds. The dark color has been assumed to provide Camouflage against the similarly colored shoreline, but its specific function has not been explained. Dark ventral plumage likely provides camouflage from active fish and crab prey. Dark dorsal plumage likely provides camouflage oil the dark shoreline from above. Although the Galapagos lacks predators, four bird species steal prey from herons, suggesting that the dark plumage of Lava Herons may function to provide camouflage against piratical birds. Whereas the complex plumage patterns of most Butorides populations renders those birds cryptic within their usual densely vegetated habitat, dark plumage is similarly cryptic along the exposed dark shoreline of the Galapagos.

Glossiness, the specular reflectance characteristic of polished surfaces, has the potential to act as a signal of quality because it depends upon material integrity and cleanliness. Here, we undertook two studies of glossiness in avian plumage to determine (a) the repeatability of a recently developed measure of glossiness, (b) the relationship between glossiness and conventional measures of coloration, and (c) how glossiness is associated with quality signaling. Using museum specimens of three North American bird species with glossy plumage (red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus; great-tailed grackle, Quiscalus mexicanus; Chihuahuan raven, Corvus cryptoleucus), we found that the glossiness measure was highly repeatable for all species and was significantly correlated with plumage coloration (e.g., chroma, brightness) in male great-tailed grackles. We then used wild-caught grackles to examine sexual dimorphism in plumage glossiness and its correlation to a potentially sexually selected trait in this species, male tail length. We found that males were significantly glossier than females and that male, but not female, glossiness correlated positively with tail length. This study provides a repeatable method to measure glossiness and highlights its potential as a signal of individual quality in animals.},

These colored areas are ornaments that correlate with pairing date and reproductive effort, and thus probably influence the choice of mates by females. Such ornaments are expected to increase in color with age and body condition. We investigated the effects of age on body condition and the {UV}-blue and chestnut coloration of males over four years using both cross-sectional (comparing age classes) and longitudinal analyses (following individuals as they age). We found that both the body condition index and brightness of {UV}-blue rump coloration increased with age, while {UV}-blue tail Plumage coloration increased between yearling and older males, and the chestnut breast coloration decreased in the oldest age class. The proximate mechanisms whereby individuals reliably signal age via rump brightness and tail coloration are probably different. Contour feathers, including rump feathers, are molted at approximately the same time in all age classes and are likely subject to the same production costs in all age classes. In contrast, the molt schedule of the tail and wing feathers differs between individuals of yearling and older age classes, with yearlings retaining wing and tail feathers for several months longer than adults. The relationship between tail color and age was probably, in part, a consequence of yearlings expressing tails that have increased feather wear and accumulation of dirt. In general, {UV}-blue coloration increased with age while chestnut plumage decreased with age, indicating that older individuals may tradeoff investing energy in structural and melanin ornaments. By assessing overall plumage coloration, female eastern bluebirds could estimate age class when choosing mates.},

In this study, we have compared strains of A. polynesiensis that are naturally and artificially infected with Wolbachia and additional strains that are aposymbiotic (Wolbachia removed to generate an uninfected strain). Artificially infected strains were observed to have increased larval mortality and decreased adult longevity when compared with aposymbiotic strains. Naturally infected strains were observed to have decreased larval mortality, pupal mortality, increased adult longevity, and a larger adult size when compared with aposymbiotic strains. Artificially infected males that were 4 wk old were able to induce high rates of {CI}, similar to young males.

	abstract = {Life history theory predicts that females should modify their investment in a particular breeding attempt according to the likelihood of its success, as the investment of females in reproduction is typically higher than that of males. The ostrich mating system is promiscuous, and is thus a particularly interesting one in which to investigate differential investment by the sexes. To date, there has been no evidence that female ostriches discriminate between males as potential mates, but the degree of dimorphism in this promiscuous species and the variation in chick size within clutches suggest that differential maternal investment is likely. We investigated the relationship between egg mass and coloration of the feathers, bill, neck and legs of 15 male ostriches, maintained in a breeding flock at an ostrich farm in South Africa. Paternity was determined using microsatellite markers. We found that the colour of the neck, white and black body feathers, and the brightness of black feathers, predicted egg mass. These traits are exposed during the male courtship display, so we suggest that these visual cues influence the degree of maternal investment in eggs through their influence on female perception of mate quality.

Structural coloration plays a key role in augmenting the skin patterning that is produced largely by neurally controlled pigmented chromatophore organs. While most iridescence and white scattering is produced by passive reflectance or diffusion, some iridophores in squid are actively controlled via a unique cholinergic, non-synaptic neural system. We review the recent anatomical and experimental evidence regarding the mechanisms of reflection and diffusion of light by the different cell types (iridophores and leucophores) of various cephalopod species. The structures that are responsible for the optical effects of some iridophores and leucophores have recently been shown to be proteins. Optical interactions with the overlying pigmented chromatophores are complex, and the recent measurements are presented and synthesized. Polarized light reflected from iridophores can be passed through the chromatophores, thus enabling the use of a discrete communication channel, because cephalopods are especially sensitive to polarized light. We illustrate how structural coloration contributes to the overall appearance of the cephalopods during intra- and interspecific behavioural interactions including camouflage.},

We examined nuclear genetic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphism and detected high levels of nuclear genetic diversity in all populations sampled.

These observations were combined with measurements of the visual environment, fish coloration and the sensitivity of visual photopigments to determine whether differential morph conspicuousness was associated with reproductive success across habitats. We found that blue and yellow males are most conspicuous in different habitats, where they also have the highest reproductive fitness. A less conspicuous grey morph also gained high reproductive success in both habitats, raising the possibility that alternative behaviours may also contribute to reproductive success. In a comprehensive analysis, conspicuousness was strongly correlated with reproductive success across morphs and environments. Our results suggest an important role for spatially heterogeneous environments in the maintenance of male colour polymorphism.},

In the Australian zebra finch, we investigated whether domesticated stock, bred in captivity over tens of generations, differ in their response to a life-history manipulation, compared to birds taken directly from the wild. In a 'common aviary' experiment, we thereto experimentally manipulated the environmental conditions experienced by nestlings early in life by means of a brood size manipulation, and subsequently assessed its short- and long-term consequences on growth, ornamentation, immune function and reproduction. As expected, we found that early environmental conditions had a marked effect on both short- and long-term morphological and life-history traits in all birds. However, although there were pronounced differences between wild and domesticated birds with respect to the absolute expression of many of these traits, which are indicative of the different selection pressures wild and domesticated birds were exposed to in the recent past, manipulated rearing conditions affected morphology and ornamentation of wild and domesticated finches in a very similar way. This suggests that despite significant differentiation between wild and domesticated birds, selection has not altered the relationships among traits. Thus, life-history strategies and investment trade-offs may be relatively stable and not easily altered by selection. This is a reassuring finding in the light of the widespread use of domesticated birds in studies of life-history evolution and sexual selection, and suggests that adaptive explanations may be legitimate when referring to captive bird studies.},

	abstract = {Ecological speciation occurs when ecologically based, divergent selection causes the evolution of reproductive isolation. There are many empirical examples of this process; however, there exists a poorly characterized stage during which the traits that distinguish species ecologically and reproductively segregate in a single population. By using a combination of genetic mapping, mate-choice experiments, field observations, and population genetics, we studied a butterfly population with a mimetic wing color polymorphism and found that the butterflies exhibited partial, color-based, assortative mate preference. These traits represent the divergent, ecologically based signal and preference components of sexual isolation that usually distinguish incipient and sibling species. The association between behavior and recognition trait in a single population may enhance the probability of speciation and provides an example of the missing link between an interbreeding population and isolated species.},

	abstract = {When males become more ornamented and reproduce more successfully as they grow older, phenotypic correlations between ornament exaggeration and reproductive success can be confounded with age effects in cross-sectional studies, and thus say relatively little about sexual selection on these traits. This is exemplified here in a correlative study of male fertilization success in a large colony of American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Previous studies of this species have indicated that two sexually dimorphic traits, tail length and ventral plumage coloration, are positively correlated with male fertilization success, and a mechanism of sexual selection by female choice has been invoked. However, these studies did not control for potential age-related variation in trait expression. Here, we show that male fertilization success was positively correlated with male tail length but not with plumage coloration. We also show that 1-year-old males had shorter tails and lower fertilization success than older males. This age effect accounted for much of the covariance between tail length and fertilization success. Still, there was a positive relationship between tail length and fertilization success among older males. But as this group consisted of males from different age classes, an age effect may be hidden in this relationship as well. Our data also revealed a longitudinal increase in both tail length and fertilization success for individual males. We argue that age-dependent ornament expression and reproductive performance in males complicate inferences about female preferences and sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Although some group-living animals dynamically modify sexual signals in response to changes in social or reproductive status, this ability is often limited by constraints inherent in the mechanism of signal production. In birds, for example, inflexible moult schedules may restrict the ability to rapidly modify plumage-based signals. In such cases, more flexible secondary signals such as skin, eye, or bill coloration (e.g. soft parts) could potentially be used to achieve dynamic signalling. We addressed the degree to which free-living red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus, can dynamically update both plumage and soft part signals when status suddenly changes, and how this may be achieved. In this cooperatively breeding passerine, dominant breeding males are distinguished from socially subordinate nonbreeding auxiliary males by the presence of nuptial plumage, dark bills and large sperm storage organs. Following an experimentally induced shift in status from auxiliary to breeder, males showed rapid increases in excreted androgen metabolites. Although they showed no overall change in nuptial plumage colour, several experimental males developed red nuptial feathers on the back following feather plucking, indicating that they had the capacity to develop bright nuptial plumage but were constrained from doing so by the moult schedule. In contrast, experimental males showed a rapid darkening of their bills, reflecting their newly acquired breeding status. These findings (1) provide experimental evidence that status affects physiologically controlled visual signals in free-living birds, (2) suggest that this linkage is mediated by testosterone and (3) illustrate how secondary ornaments may be used in dynamic signalling when the primary signalling modality is constrained.

Feather colour can change after moult, and dirt accumulation has been suggested to contribute to this variation. However, we still know little about the influence of dirt on feather colour change, possibly because it is difficult to experimentally manipulate the level of feather dirtiness. We investigated whether reflectance properties of feathers exposed to naturally deposited soil (atmospheric particle deposition such as dust, pollution and smoke) differ from feathers for which this contact was prevented. To achieve this, we compared the spectral colour of throat-breast feathers of European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, kept in the open air (dirty group) with those preserved within a plastic envelope (clean group). Before treatment and three and six weeks after the beginning of the treatment we measured the plumage reflectance of the two groups of feathers. While clean feathers did not change their reflectance spectra, the dirty group showed a reduced reflectance along the entire spectrum (300-700 nm). The reduction in reflectance was particularly pronounced in the {UV} range (300-400 nm). These preliminary results are consistent with the idea that feather colours are not static signals but are plastic traits. However, much work remains to determine the role of soil and air pollution in altering plumage colouration.},

The behaviours of the males were categorized into three types: lateral-circular wave and lateral-straight wave for courting, and repelling. Before painting, almost all of the males courted the females. After painting, significantly fewer males courted the red-, black- and blue-painted females than courted the white-painted females.

Iridescent colour signals are directional but, like diffusely reflected colours, vary within and among species in ways that may be adaptations to specific types of receivers in specific light environments. 2. The hindwings of pipevine swallowtail butterflies exhibit brilliant blue and iridescent colour patches on the ventral surface in both sexes and on the dorsal wing surface in males. Evidence suggests that the ventral iridescent blue is a component of the warning coloration of this distasteful species, while the dorsal blue iridescent wing area is a sexual signal. Given differences in the function and ecological context of signal production, we analysed reflectance spectra from the iridescent blue areas of both field-caught and laboratory-reared animals to test several predictions about the iridescent colour patches on these wing surfaces. 3. The ventral blue patches in the warning coloration of males and females should be most visible early and late in the day, due to wing orientation relative to sun angle. We therefore predicted that these iridescent colour patches would be brighter and of longer wavelengths than the male dorsal blue patch displayed during midday courtships. The prediction about reflectance intensity was supported but the prediction about hue was not. 4. We predicted that the sexually selected dorsal hindwing iridescence of males would be more variable among individuals and condition dependent than the naturally selected ventral iridescent colour patches. To assess variation and condition dependence, laboratory-reared and field-captured individuals were compared. The prediction about variation was not supported, but only the dorsal wing surfaces showed evidence of being condition dependent. 5. We investigated whether development of dorsal and ventral blue iridescence was coupled by determining correlations in colour properties between the wing surfaces. Our finding of positive correlations indicated a potential developmental constraint in the evolution of colour differences between the two wing surfaces. 6. Results of this study suggest that some properties of iridescent coloration on the hindwing of the pipevine swallowtail (especially intensity) may have been fine-tuned by evolution in response to prevailing ambient light conditions and viewing perspectives that differ among types of signal receivers.},

Egg colour was not significantly correlated with estimates of female quality (clutch size, average egg volume, first egg laying date and feeding rate). There was a significant decrease in chroma and increase in brightness and egg volume during the laying sequence, with some marked differences between six-egg and seven-egg clutches that might reflect differences in female quality. However, we found no significant influence of egg colour (foster or original clutch) on male feeding rate or offspring viability (hatching success, average mass and fledging success) and no significant difference in feeding rate for males with six-egg and seven-egg foster or original clutches. We conclude that Norwegian male pied flycatchers do not use egg colour as a cue to female quality, thus questioning the generality of previous support for the sexually selected egg colour hypothesis from this species.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are widespread among insects and in many cases cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Such findings have been used to argue that Wolbachia have played an important role in insect speciation. Theoretical models, however, indicate that Wolbachia alone are unlikely to lead to stable reproductive isolation between two formerly conspecific populations. Here we analyze the components of reproductive isolation between Drosophila recens, which is infected with Wolbachia. and its uninfected sister species Drosophila subquinaria. Laboratory pairings demonstrated that gene flow via matings between D, recens females and D. subquinaria males is hindered by behavioral isolation. Matings readily occurred in the reciprocal cross (D. quinaria females X D. recens males), but very few viable progeny were produced. The production of viable hybrids via this route was restored by antibiotic curing of D. recens of their Wolbachia symbionts, indicating that hybrid offspring production is greatly reduced by cytoplasmic incompatibility in the crosses involving infected D. recens males. Thus, behavioral isolation and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility act as complementary asymmetrical isolating mechanisms between these two species. In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybrid females were fertile, whereas hybrid males invariably were sterile. Levels of {mtDNA} variation in D. recens are much lower than in either D. subquinaria or D. falleni, neither of which is infected with Wolbachia. The low haplotype diversity in D. recens is likely due to an {mtDNA} sweep associated with the spread of Wolbachia. Nevertheless, the existence of several {mtDNA} haplotypes in this species indicates that Wolbachia have been present as a potential isolating mechanism for a substantial period of evolutionary time. Finally, we argue that although Wolbachia by themselves are unlikely to bring about speciation, they can increase the rate of speciation in insects.},

Disturbingly, the geographic range of dengue is currently expanding and the severity of outbreaks is increasing(2-4). Control options for dengue are very limited and currently focus on reducing population abundance of the major mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti(5,6). These strategies are failing to reduce dengue incidence in tropical communities and there is an urgent need for effective alternatives. It has been proposed that endosymbiotic bacterial Wolbachia infections of insects might be used in novel strategies for dengue control(7-9). For example, the {wMelPop}-{CLA} Wolbachia strain reduces the lifespan of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes in stably transinfected lines(8). This life-shortening phenotype was predicted to reduce the potential for dengue transmission. The recent discovery that several Wolbachia infections, including {wMelPop}-{CLA}, can also directly influence the susceptibility of insects to infection with a range of insect and human pathogens(9-11) has markedly changed the potential for Wolbachia infections to control human diseases. Here we describe the successful transinfection of A. aegypti with the avirulent {wMel} strain of Wolbachia, which induces the reproductive phenotype cytoplasmic incompatibility with minimal apparent fitness costs and high maternal transmission, providing optimal phenotypic effects for invasion. Under semi-field conditions, the {wMel} strain increased from an initial starting frequency of 0.65 to near fixation within a few generations, invading A. aegypti populations at an accelerated rate relative to trials with the {wMelPop}-{CLA} strain. We also show that {wMel} and {wMelPop}-{CLA} strains block transmission of dengue serotype 2 ({DENV}-2) in A. aegypti, forming the basis of a practical approach to dengue suppression(12).},

	abstract = {Abstract Giant Galápagos tortoises represent an interesting model for the study of patterns of genetic divergence and adaptive differentiation related to island colonization events. Recent mitochondrial {DNA} work elucidated the evolutionary history of the species and helped to clarify aspects of nomenclature. We used 10 microsatellite loci to assess levels of genetic divergence among and within island populations. In particular, we described the genetic structure of tortoises on the island of Isabela, where discrimination of different taxa is still subject of debate. Individual island populations were all genetically distinct. The island of Santa Cruz harboured two distinct populations. On Isabela, populations of Volcan Wolf, Darwin and Alcedo were significantly different from each other. On the other hand, Volcan Wolf showed allelic similarity with the island of Santiago. On Southern Isabela, lower genetic divergence was found between Northeast Sierra Negra and Volcan Alcedo, while patterns of gene flow were recorded among tortoises of Cerro Azul and Southeast Sierra Negra. These tortoises have endured heavy exploitation during the last three centuries and recently attracted much concern due to the current number of stochastic and deterministic threats to extant populations. Our study complements previous investigation based on {mtDNA} diversity and provides further information that may help devising tortoise management plans. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

This incompatibility between sperm and egg is evident when uninfected females mate with infected males. Wolbachia-driven reproductive incompatibilities are of special interest because they may play a role in speciation. However, the presence of Wolbachia does not always imply incompatibility. The field crickets Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus exhibit a very clear unidirectional incompatibility and have been cited as a possible example of Wolbachia-induced {CI}. Here, we conduct curing experiments, intra- and interspecific crosses, cytological examination of Wolbachia in testes and Wolbachia quantifications through real-time {PCR}. All of our data strongly suggest that Wolbachia are not involved in the reproductive incompatibility between G. firmus and G. pennsylvanicus.},

We cloned and sequenced a {UV} opsin {mRNA} transcript from Bombus impatiens head-specific {cDNA} and, using western blot analysis, detected an eye protein band of ∼41 {kDa}, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the encoded opsin. We then characterized {UV} opsin expression in the retina, ocelli and brain using immunocytochemistry. In the main retina, we found three different ommatidial types with respect to the number of {UV} opsin-expressing photoreceptor cells, namely ommatidia containing two, one or no {UV} opsin-immunoreactive cells. We also observed {UV} opsin expression in the ocelli. These results indicate that the cloned opsin probably encodes the P350 nm pigment, which was previously characterized by physiological recordings. Surprisingly, in addition to expression in the retina and ocelli, we found opsin expression in different parts of the brain. {UV} opsin immunoreactivity was detected in the proximal rim of the lamina adjacent to the first optic chiasm, which is where studies in other insects have found expression of proteins involved in the circadian clock, period and cryptochrome. We also found {UV} opsin immunoreactivity in the core region of the antennal lobe glomeruli and different clusters of perikarya within the protocerebrum, indicating a putative function of these brain regions, together with the lamina organ, in the entrainment of circadian rhythms. In order to test for a possible overlap of clock protein and {UV} opsin spatial expression, we also examined the expression of the period protein in these regions.},

Although this dichromatism has been found in plumage produced through a variety of proximate mechanisms, little is known about how dichromatism varies across these types of plumage within a single species. We used a reflectance spectrometer to measure colour within the Green-backed Tit Parus monticolus, a species which displays multiple types of pigment and structural colours. We found significant differences in spectral measurements corresponding to hue, chroma, and brightness between male and female carotenoid, melanin, structural white, grey and structural blue plumage. The only plumage that did not appear to show sexual dichromatism was the olive plumage of the back. These findings suggest that the mechanism(s) producing cryptic dichromatism in the Green-backed Tit are non-specific and act across multiple types of plumage, rather than within a single type, such as carotenoid-based or structurally produced.},

The cover scales in the coloured bands contain a violet-absorbing, blue-fluorescing pigment. The fluorescence and absorbance spectra of the nireus group wings are very similar to those of the wings of the Japanese yellow swallowtail, Papilio xuthus, and thus the pigment is presumably papiliochrome {II}. The scale structures of P. xuthus are arranged irregularly, and both the fluorescence and light reflection are diffuse. In the nireus papilionids, the spatial fluorescence distribution of the scales is also diffuse, but the reflection is specular. The scales have a multilayered structure, consisting of two main laminae. We show that the papiliochrome {II} pigment in the upper lamina of the scales functions as a violet-blocking long-pass filter in front of the lower lamina, thus limiting the reflectance spectrum to the blue-green wavelength range. Optical modelling showed that the papiliochrome {II} filter effectively removes the angle dependency of the reflectance spectra – that is, it reduces the wing iridescence. The contribution of the fluorescence signal to the visual appearance is minor.},

Here, we use spectrophotometric analyses to show that the decorations of all five tested spider species are visible to honey bees and birds over short and long distances. Furthermore, the discoid decorations of one species may provide some protection against arthropod predators. However, these decorations are inefficient at camouflaging the spider against birds, despite the overlap between the spider's body and web decoration.},

	abstract = {In sexual selection, multimodal signals elicit mate choice when more than one sensory modality is activated. However, determining the relative use of each signal is difficult because it requires a comprehensive understanding of the mating system and how this system works under natural conditions. We examined the role of structural ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance and pheromones in the butterfly Colias eurytheme. Both traits are important in mediating interspecific interactions and pheromones have been implicated in intra-specific mate choice. {UV} reflectance, which arises from the presence of a multilayer thin-film interference array, has potential as an honest indicator of male condition, viability and/or age. We investigated the relevance of these signal traits to courtship success by releasing virgin females in the path of free-flying males until each female had rejected and accepted at least one male. This design facilitated a within-subjects (females) analysis of mate choice, thus controlling for potentially confounding variation in intrinsic female receptivity. Principal component analysis indicated that variation across males in {UV} brightness and pheromones was essentially orthogonal. Females preferred younger males (as subjectively adjudged by wing wear), and while age covaried with {UV} brightness and almost all pheromone descriptors, {UV} brightness emerged as the best and most general predictor of male mating success. Our results suggest that this trait serves as an important intraspecific sexual signal in C. eurytheme, and they provide the clearest evidence to date regarding the functional relevance of structural coloration to female mate choice in butterflies. We discuss the preferential use of one secondary sexual characteristic ({UV} reflectance) over another (pheromones) with regard to evolutionary strategies.

Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers. These differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the Psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation, in addition to their role in communication and camouflage.},

The complete sequence is presented of the 1.48-Mbp genome of {wPip} which encodes 1386 coding sequences ({CDSs}), representing the first genome sequence of a B-supergroup Wolbachia. Comparisons were made with the smaller genomes of Wolbachia strains {wMel} of Drosophila melanogaster, an A-supergroup Wolbachia that is also a {CI} inducer, and {wBm}, a mutualist of Brugia malayi nematodes that belongs to the D-supergroup of Wolbachia. Despite extensive gene order rearrangement, a core set of Wolbachia genes shared between the 3 genomes can be identified and contrasts with a flexible gene pool where rapid evolution has taken place. There are much more extensive prophage and ankyrin repeat encoding ({ANK}) gene components of the {wPip} genome compared with {wMel} and {wBm}, and both are likely to be of considerable importance in {wPip} biology. Five {WO}-B–like prophage regions are present and contain some genes that are identical or highly similar in multiple prophage copies, whereas other genes are unique, and it is likely that extensive recombination, duplication, and insertion have occurred between copies. A much larger number of genes encode ankyrin repeat ({ANK}) proteins in {wPip}, with 60 present compared with 23 in {wMel}, many of which are within or close to the prophage regions. It is likely that this pattern is partly a result of expansions in the {wPip} lineage, due for example to gene duplication, but their presence is in some cases more ancient. The {wPip} genome underlines the considerable evolutionary flexibility of Wolbachia, providing clear evidence for the rapid evolution of {ANK}-encoding genes and of prophage regions. This host–Wolbachia system, with its complex patterns of sterility induced between populations, now provides an excellent model for unraveling the molecular systems underlying host reproductive manipulation.},

This study on host search in butterflies examines the following questions in all ecologically relevant context: i) does cue learning depend on the sensory environment in which learning Occurs: and ii) are background characteristics learned. such that performance on novel tasks in the same sensory environment is facilitated? Females of Battus philenor (Papilionidae: Lepidoptera) were trained to different coloured and shaped oviposition targets, against different background colours. Individuals trained to colours on a brown background but tested on a green background performed significantly, worse than control individuals which were trained to the same colours but oil a green back-round. Females pre-trained to discriminate green targets from red targets on a green background colour performed significantly better in a novel task (shape learning) involving green shapes oil a green background than did individuals trained to discriminate the same colours on a brown back-round. These two results were unique to particular cue-background combinations, in particular cryptic conditions. Taken to-ether. our results suggest that cue learning depends on an insect's sensory environment, and that learning characteristics of local backgrounds may confer benefits to habitat-faithful individuals.},

Although such predation costs have repeatedly been proposed for various ornaments of birds, especially for melanised and depigmented signals with low presumed production costs, tests of this hypothesis are rare and inconclusive. In this study we investigated whether individual variation in plumage ornamentation was associated with predator-related risk-taking behaviour and short-term survival in free-living House Sparrows Passer domesticus. In a large sample of birds we measured three aspects of coloration used in sexual and social signalling: the size of the melanised black throat patch in males, and the area and conspicuousness of the depigmented wing-bar in both sexes. We measured risk-taking by manipulating the distance of feeders from shelters, and recorded individually ringed birds feeding close to and far from shelter. Sparrows seemed to perceive the farther feeders as more risky, as indicated by the shorter time spent and smaller groups feeding far from rather than close to shelter. However, the use of the more risky (farther) feeders was not related to any of the colour traits we measured, suggesting that Sparrows do not adjust their risk-taking behaviour to their ornamentation. Males (the more ornamented sex) did not take less risk than females. Furthermore, we found no evidence that larger throat patches or more ornamented wing-bars reduced the probability of survival. Our findings were robust and consistent across multiple approaches, even when we controlled for several potential confounding effects. These results do not support the suggestion that melanised and depigmented plumage ornaments have significant predation costs in House Sparrows.},

	abstract = {Hitherto, most of the investigation on the perceptual efficacy of begging signals has dwelled on how patterns of nestling colouration adjust to predominant nest luminosity. However, visual sensitivity of birds varies across species, which raises the question of whether colouration of traits involved in begging displays is adjusted to parent visual capacities. Here, by comparing nestling colouration and visual sensitivity across 22 altricial bird species, we provide a first test of this hypothesis. Firstly, we assessed differences in performance of typical {UV}-tuned and violet-tuned bird eyes when looking at the nestling traits under the light regimes prevailing at their nests. Secondly, while controlling for common ancestry in a comparative approach, we explored variation in colouration of nestlings in relation to parent visual system. The colour discrimination model indicated a general higher performance of the ultraviolet over the violet eye at detecting gape and body skin traits in either open- or hole-nest light conditions. Gape colouration was associated with parental visual system as the nestlings of {UVS} species displayed more yellow and less pure ultraviolet mouths than the nestlings of {VS} species. Thus, our results agree with an adaptive parent-offspring communication scenario where the nestlings' colours tuned the perception capacities of their parents.},

	abstract = {A tremendous diversity of avian color displays has stimulated numerous studies of natural and sexual selection. Yet, the developmental mechanisms that produce such diversification, and thus the proximate targets of selection pressures, are rarely addressed and poorly understood. In particular, because feathers are colored during growth, the dynamics of feather growth play a deterministic role in the variation in ornamentation. No study to date, however, has addressed the contribution of feather growth to the expression of carotenoid-based ornamentation. Here, we examine the developmental basis of variation ill ornamental feather shapes in male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus)-a species in which carotenoid displays are under strong natural and sexual selection. First, we use geometric morphometrics to partition the observed shape variation in fully grown feathers among populations, ages, degrees of elaboration, ornamental body parts, and individuals. Second, we use a biologically informed mathematical model of feather growth to predict variation in shape of ornamental feathers due to simulated growth rate, angle of helical growth of feather barbs, initial number of barb ridges, rate of addition of new barbs, barb diameter, and ramus-expansion angle. We find close concordance between among-individual variation in feather shape and hue of entire ornament, and show that this concordance call be attributed to a shared mechanism-growth rate of feather barbs. Predicted differences in feather shape due to rate of addition of barbs and helical angle of feather growth explained observed variation in ornamental area both among individuals and between populations, whereas differences in helical angle of growth and the number of barbs in the feather follicle explained differences in feather shape between ornamental parts and among males of different ages. The findings of a close association of feather growth dynamics and overall ornamentation identify the proximate targets of selection for elaboration of sexual displays. Moreover, the close association of feather growth and pigmentation not only can reinforce condition-dependence in color displays, but can also enable phenotypic and genetic accommodation of novel pigments into plumage displays providing a mechanism for the observed concordance of within-population developmental processes and between-population diversification of color displays.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Maternal investment in egg quality can have important consequences for offspring fitness. For example, yolk antioxidants can affect embryonic development as well as juvenile and adult phenotype. Thus, females may be selected to advertise their yolk antioxidant deposition to discriminatory males via ornamental signals, perhaps depending on the reproductive costs associated with signal production. 2. Female striped plateau lizards (Sceloporus virgatus) develop pterin-based orange colour patches during the reproductive season that influence male behaviour and that are positively associated with the phenotypic quality of the female and her offspring. Here, we assessed one potential developmental mechanism underlying the relationship between offspring quality and female ornamentation in S. virgatus, by examining the relationship between ornament expression and yolk antioxidant levels. 3. As expected, concentrations of the yolk antioxidants vitamin A, vitamin E and carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) were strongly positively intercorrelated. Eggs from larger clutches had fewer antioxidants than eggs from smaller clutches, suggesting that females may be limited in antioxidant availability or use. Fertilized and unfertilized eggs did not differ in yolk antioxidant levels. 4. The size of a female's ornament was positively related to both the concentration and total amount of yolk antioxidants, and ornament colour was positively related to yolk antioxidant concentration. Thus, in S. virgatus, female ornaments may advertise egg quality. In addition, these data suggest that more ornamented females may produce higher-quality offspring, in part because their eggs contain more antioxidants. As the colour ornament of interest is derived from pterins, not carotenoids, direct resource trade-offs between ornaments and eggs may be eliminated, reducing reproductive costs associated with signalling. 5. This is the first example of a positive relationship between female ornamentation and yolk antioxidants in reptiles and may indicate the general importance of these patterns in oviparous vertebrates.},

Considering the nesting environment of the Village Weaver and the putative pre-parasitism ancestral egg color, I hypothesize that blue-green pigment may protect Village Weaver embryos from solar radiation. On this basis, more intense (more chromatic) blue-green egg colors may have evolved by natural selection in Village Weavers in the absence of Diederik Cuckoos. Moreover, even in African populations that are parasitized, Village Weaver eggs may have diverged in accordance with nesting light environments. In accordance with the proposed hypothesis, over the past two centuries two introduced populations have evolved more intense blue-green egg colors compared with their source populations. Two African source populations also differ from each other in the predicted direction, the population with the sunnier nesting climate having more intensely blue-green eggs. These results suggest that upon relaxation of brood parasitism by an egg mimic, Village Weaver eggs may adapt to solar radiation. Received 13 February 2007 accepted 23 February 2008.},

To reduce these costs, hosts of avian brood parasites have evolved various defenses, of which egg rejection is the most prevalent. In the face of variable host-parasite mimicry and the costs of egg discrimination itself, many hosts reject only some foreign eggs. Here, we experimentally varied the recognition cues to study the underlying cognitive mechanisms used by the Chalk-browed Mockingbird (Mimus saturninus) to reject the white immaculate eggs laid by the parasitic Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis). Immaculate eggs are the only parasite eggs rejected by this host, as it accepts all polymorphic, spotted eggs laid by cowbirds. Using a within-breeding pair experimental design, we tested for the salience of spotting, {UV} reflectance, and brightness in eliciting rejection. We found that the presence of spotting significantly decreased the probability of rejection while increments in brightness significantly increased rejection frequencies. The cognitive rules underlying mockingbird rejection behavior can be explained by a decision-making model which predicts changes in the levels of rejection in direct relation to the number of relevant attributes shared between host and parasite eggs.},

The trained butterflies were tested on their ability to perceive brightness in two different protocols: (i) two orange discs of different intensity presented on the same intensity grey background and (ii) two orange discs of the same intensity separately presented on a grey background that was either higher or lower in intensity than the training background. The butterflies trained to high intensity red selected the orange disc of high intensity in protocol 1, and the disc on the background of low intensity grey in protocol 2. We obtained similar results in another set of experiments with purple discs instead of orange discs. The choices of the butterflies trained to low intensity red were opposite to those just described.

Established theory predicts that aposematic signals should evolve towards increased conspicuousness and similarity to enhance predator education. Contrary to theoretical expectations, there is often considerable within- and between-species variation in aposematic signals of animals sharing the same ecological niche, phylogeny and predators. This may be explained by varying responses of predators that weaken the selection pressure for a consistent signal. By presenting painted mealworm larvae as prey to great tits as predators we tested if different aposematic colour patterns have different values as a means of initial protection and learnt avoidance from predators, and how widely birds generalise their learnt avoidance to other colour patterns. We also investigated how the colour and luminance of the pattern elements affect predator attack decisions. Finally, we studied if hunger affects the predators' reaction to differently coloured prey. We found that similarity in colour was not crucial to the survival of aposematic prey, since learnt avoidance was not influenced by colour, and predators remembered and generalised widely in their learnt avoidance to other colours. We found that initial avoidance was, however, apparently influenced by luminance contrast. Interestingly, the predators' level of hunger was more important than the colour of the aposematic signal in determining birds' decisions to attack chemically-defended insect larvae. We discuss the implications of visual properties of prey colour pattern and predator appetite for the evolution of insect defences and warning signals. In addition we propose a methodological approach to effectively control for predator appetite in laboratory experiments.},

The expression of a male display trait is proportional to genetic quality, which is determined by the number of deleterious mutations a male carries throughout his genome. Genetic variances and covariances, including the covariance between the preference and male trait that drives the good genes process, are allowed to evolve under an infinitesimal model. Results suggest that the good genes process generates only weak indirect selection on preferences, with an effective selection intensity of a few percent or less. If preferences are subject to direct natural selection of the intensity observed for other characters, the good genes process alone is not expected to exaggerate the male trait by more than a few phenotypic standard deviations, contrary to what is observed in highly sexually selected species. Good genes can, however, cause substantial exaggeration if preference genes are nearly selectively neutral. Alternatively, direct selection on preference genes, acting on mating behavior itself or on the genes' pleiotropic effects, can cause mating preferences and male display traits to be exaggerated by any degree. Direct selection of preference genes may therefore play an important role in species that show extreme sexual selection.},

Traits subject to disruptive selection that also contribute to non-random mating will facilitate speciation with gene flow. Such 'magic' or 'multiple-effect' traits may be widespread and important for generating biodiversity, but strong empirical evidence is still lacking. Although there is evidence that putative ecological traits are indeed involved in assortative mating, evidence that these same traits are under divergent selection is considerably weaker. Heliconius butterfly wing patterns are subject to positive frequency-dependent selection by predators, owing to aposematism and Mullerian mimicry, and divergent colour patterns are used by closely related species to recognize potential mates. The amenability of colour patterns to experimental manipulation, independent of other traits, presents an excellent opportunity to test their role during speciation. We conducted field experiments with artificial butterflies, designed to match natural butterflies with respect to avian vision. These were complemented with enclosure trials with live birds and real butterflies. Our experiments showed that hybrid colour-pattern phenotypes are attacked more frequently than parental forms. For the first time, we demonstrate disruptive ecological selection on a trait that also acts as a mating cue.},

	abstract = {Fast dynamic control of skin coloration is rare in the animal kingdom, whether it be pigmentary or structural. Iridescent structural coloration results when nanoscale structures disrupt incident light and selectively reflect specific colours. Unlike animals with fixed iridescent coloration (e.g. butterflies), squid iridophores (i.e. aggregations of iridescent cells in the skin) produce dynamically tuneable structural coloration, as exogenous application of acetylcholine ({ACh}) changes the colour and brightness output. Previous efforts to stimulate iridophores neurally or to identify the source of endogenous {ACh} were unsuccessful, leaving researchers to question the activation mechanism. We developed a novel neurophysiological preparation in the squid Doryteuthis pealeii and demonstrated that electrical stimulation of neurons in the skin shifts the spectral peak of the reflected light to shorter wavelengths (greater than 145 nm) and increases the peak reflectance (greater than 245\%) of innervated iridophores. We show {ACh} is released within the iridophore layer and that extensive nerve branching is seen within the iridophore. The dynamic colour shift is significantly faster (17 s) than the peak reflectance increase (32 s), revealing two distinct mechanisms. Responses from a structurally altered preparation indicate that the reflectin protein condensation mechanism explains peak reflectance change, while an undiscovered mechanism causes the fast colour shift.},

	abstract = {Flower visitors of several taxa (including bees, butterflies and hoverflies) are known to move preferentially between flowers of the same species, while neglecting other equally rewarding flower species. Darwin proposed memory limitations as a potential mechanistic explanation for this flower constancy behaviour. This reanalysis of a previously published dataset, relating a real-time sequential analysis of bumblebee flower choices to the distance distribution between flowers in a natural meadow, shows that Darwin was right in an unexpected way. Bees (Bombus spp) can learn how to extract rewards from several flower species, and switching between flower species does not compromise their handling efficiency (ie flower handling times do not increase following a species switch). However, bees do lose time flying between flowers. If a flower is encountered within a short time (0-2 sees) after the last flower visit, it is likely to be visited only if it is the same species. After longer intervals (3-6 sees), bees are more likely to switch to visiting different flower species. Thus, flower constancy is in part an effect based on comparing incoming stimuli (the flowers a bee detects in flight) with a transient form of short-term (working) memory, which holds the signal of the last visited flower. The relative weighting of working and reference memory changes as time passes following a flower visit. This results in a low probability of retrieving the memory for a different flower species (from that just visited) within a short time interval after the most recent flower visit (0-2 sees). This probability rises as the signal of the last visited flower fades from working memory ({\textgreater} 2 sees).},

The visual modelling of experimental and natural eggshell colours suggests that photon capture from the ultraviolet and short wavelength-sensitive cones elicits egg rejection decisions in song thrushes, while inter-clutch variation of egg coloration provides sufficient contrasts for detecting conspecific parasitism in this species.

Previous work has shown that {FDB} alter the coloration of structurally-colored bluebird feathers in vitro (Shawkey et al. 2007). In a correlational study of how bacteria affect birds in the wild, we found that female plumage got duller with increasing {FDB} intensity. Males tended to get brighter with increasing {FDB} intensity, but the relationship was not significant. We also found significant associations between plumage bacteria intensity and body condition, but, again, with gender-based differences. Female body condition was negatively associated with plumage bacteria intensity, while male body condition was positively associated with plumage bacteria intensity. Interestingly, plumage bacteria intensity of males and females in nesting pairs was significantly positively correlated. We also report the highest prevalence of {FDB} measured in a wild bird population, with {FDB} detected on 67/68 (99\%) of individuals. Further work is needed to fully understand the relationships between plumage bacteria and birds, but our data indicate that plumage bacteria may have sex-dependent effects on multiple phenotypic traits.},

	abstract = {Museum specimens continue to be an invaluable resource for taxonomic, systematic, and comparative studies, and are increasingly relied upon for novel research purposes. Evaluating variation in the colour of avian study skins forms the basis for a broad range of research questions, yet few studies have investigated whether the plumage colouration of museum specimens accurately reflects colouration in wild birds. In this study, we use reflectance spectrometry to compare the plumage reflectance of avian museum skins and wild birds. We use long-tailed manakins Chiroxiphia linearis, to investigate these potential differences in colour. Long-tailed manakins are ideal for this type of study as their colourful plumage patches result from three primary plumage colouration mechanisms found in birds: melanin pigmentation, carotenoid pigmentation, and structural colouration. These features of their plumage allowed us to independently assess variation in each plumage colouration mechanism. Reflectance spectra obtained from museum specimens were very similar to those obtained from wild birds, and the colouration of specimens was usually well within the range of variation observed in wild birds. As such, museum specimens can accurately represent the colouration of wild birds. Nevertheless, we found significant differences in colouration between museum skins and wild birds. We documented differences in brightness, hue, saturation, and chroma, although the direction and magnitude of these differences varied by mechanism of colouration. Multivariate analyses revealed that the age of museum specimens and the time of year at which they were collected contributed to some of these differences. We discuss potential proximate causes of these changes in colour, many of which apply to both museum specimens and wild birds, and identify the types of studies that are likely to be most sensitive to these changes.},

The orchids mimic the sex pheromone of receptive female insects, mainly hymenopterans, in order to attract males seeking to copulate. Most Ophrys species have achromatic flowers, but some exhibit a coloured perianth and a bright, conspicuous labellum pattern. We recently showed that the pink perianth of Ophrys heldreichii flowers increases detectability by its pollinator, males of the long-horned bee Eucera berlandi. Here we tested the hypothesis that the bright, complex labellum pattern mimics the female of the pollinator to increase attractiveness toward males. In a dual-choice test we offered E. berlandi males an O. heldreichii flower and a flower from O. dictynnae, which also exhibits a pinkish perianth but no conspicuous labellum pattern. Both flowers were housed in {UV}-transmitting acrylic glass boxes to exclude olfactory signals. Males significantly preferred O. heldreichii to O. dictynnae flowers. In a second experiment, we replaced the perianth of both flowers with identical artificial perianths made from pink card, so that only the labellum differed between the two flower stimuli. Males then chose between both stimuli at random, suggesting that the presence of a labellum pattern does not affect their choice. Spectral measurements revealed higher colour contrast with the background of the perianth of O. heldreichii compared to O. dictynnae, but no difference in green receptor-specific contrast or brightness. Our results show that male choice is guided by the chromatic contrast of the perianth during the initial flower approach but is not affected by the presence of a labellum pattern. Instead, we hypothesise that the labellum pattern is involved in aversive learning during post-copulatory behaviour and used by the orchid as a strategy to increase outcrossing.},

However, no study has been carried out on species whose carotenoids are metabolically modified before deposition. In this study, we assess age-related changes in the carotenoid-based coloration of European Serins, a species that metabolically processes carotenoids before they can be deposited into feathers. Birds were captured over consecutive years and we carried out both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Adults had significantly greater values of lightness and chroma than yearling birds. However, there were no changes in plumage colour when analysing the same individuals captured in subsequent seasons. Plumage lightness and chroma of adult males after moult were related to body mass, suggesting a role of body condition on plumage coloration. Our results suggest that changes in plumage coloration with age in European Serins are due to a selection process that favours more intensely coloured individuals.},

	abstract = {Relative to other metazoans, the mammalian integument is thought to be limited in colour. In particular, while iridescence is widespread among birds and arthropods, it has only rarely been reported in mammals. Here, we examine the colour, morphology and optical mechanisms in hairs from four species of golden mole (Mammalia: Chrysochloridae) that are characterized by sheens ranging from purple to green. Microspectrophotometry reveals that this colour is weak and variable. Iridescent hairs are flattened and have highly reduced cuticular scales, providing a broad and smooth surface for light reflection. These scales form multiple layers of light and dark materials of consistent thickness, strikingly similar to those in the elytra of iridescent beetles. Optical modelling suggests that the multi-layers produce colour through thin-film interference, and that the sensitivity of this mechanism to slight changes in layer thickness and number explains colour variability. While coloured integumentary structures are typically thought to evolve as sexual ornaments, the blindness of golden moles suggests that the colour may be an epiphenomenon resulting from evolution via other selective factors, including the ability to move and keep clean in dirt and sand.},

We further introduce an age-structured model that takes into account different fertility and mortality rates at different stages of the life cycle of the individuals. With only a few parameters, the ordinary differential equation models exhibit already interesting dynamics and can be used to predict criteria under which a strain of bacteria is able to invade a population. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the age-structured model shows significant differences concerning the existence and stability of equilibrium solutions compared to the unstructured model.},

	abstract = {Animal colouration is typically the product of nanostructures that reflect or scatter light and pigments that absorb it. The interplay between these colour-producing mechanisms may influence the efficacy and potential information content of colour signals, but this notion has received little empirical attention. Wing scales in the male orange sulphur butterfly (Colias eurytheme) possess ridges with lamellae that produce a brilliant iridescent ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance via thin-film interference. Curiously, these same scales contain pterin pigments that strongly absorb wavelengths below 550 nm. Given that male {UV} reflectance functions as a sexual signal in C. eurytheme, it is paradoxical that pigments in the wing scales are highly {UV} absorbing. We present spectrophotometric analyses of the wings before and after pterin removal that show that pterins both depress the amplitude of {LTV} iridescence and suppress a diffuse {UV} reflectance that emanates from the scales. This latter effect enhances the directionality and spectral purity of the iridescence, and increases the signal's chromaticity and potential signal content. Our findings also suggest that pterins amplify the contrast between iridescent {UV} reflectance and scale background colour as a male's wings move during flight.},

Many carotenoid-based signals are regulated by testosterone (T), which has been suggested to impose a cost to the signaller by suppression of the immune system or an increase in oxidative stress. Results are, however, inconsistent, which may be due to the fact that T can be metabolised to both 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone ({DHT}, a potent androgen) and oestradiol (E2, a potent oestrogen). To evaluate for the first time the independent effect of these testosterone metabolites on oxidative status, circulating carotenoids and a carotenoid-dependent sexual signal, we administered {DHT} and E2 to captive non-breeding adult kestrels Falco tinnunculus of both sexes. E2 increased oxidative damage and downregulated the antioxidant barrier without affecting colouration or circulating carotenoids. In contrast, {DHT} did not affect oxidative status, but increased skin redness, again without affecting circulating carotenoids. No sex-specific effects were found. These results suggest that the pro-oxidant activity of T could be induced indirectly by its metabolite, E2, whereas the other metabolite, {DHT}, stimulates signal expression. Finally, the study shows that changes in oxidative damage or antioxidant status of plasma were not correlated with either skin redness or circulating carotenoids.},

	abstract = {The butterfly Heliconius erato can see from the {UV} to the red part of the light spectrum with color vision proven from 440 to 640 nm. Its eye is known to contain three visual pigments, rhodopsins, produced by an 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore together with long wavelength ({LWRh}), blue ({BRh}) and {UV} ({UVRh}1) opsins. We now find that H. erato has a second {UV} opsin {mRNA} ({UVRh}2)—a previously undescribed duplication of this gene among Lepidoptera. To investigate its evolutionary origin, we screened eye {cDNAs} from 14 butterfly species in the subfamily Heliconiinae and found both copies only among Heliconius. Phylogeny-based tests of selection indicate positive selection of {UVRh}2 following duplication, and some of the positively selected sites correspond to vertebrate visual pigment spectral tuning residues. Epi-microspectrophotometry reveals two {UV}-absorbing rhodopsins in the H. erato eye with λmax = 355 nm and 398 nm. Along with the additional {UV} opsin, Heliconius have also evolved 3-hydroxy-{DL}-kynurenine (3-{OHK})-based yellow wing pigments not found in close relatives. Visual models of how butterflies perceive wing color variation indicate this has resulted in an expansion of the number of distinguishable yellow colors on Heliconius wings. Functional diversification of the {UV}-sensitive visual pigments may help explain why the yellow wing pigments of Heliconius are so colorful in the {UV} range compared to the yellow pigments of close relatives lacking the {UV} opsin duplicate.},

This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the predation rates of local bumblebees with those of imported non-native bumblebees, whose coat colour is different from that of local bees, so that their coloration is unfamiliar to local predators. To test whether populations of non-native bumblebees suffer higher worker loss rates during foraging, we conducted transplant experiments in the {UK}, Germany and Sardinia. The loss rates of foraging workers of four Bombus terrestris populations (Bombus terrestris canariensis, Bombus terrestris terrestris, Bombus terrestris sassaricus and Bombus terrestris dalmatinus) were compared, evaluating data from 989 foragers, whose flight times were monitored precisely (over 8258 h of foraging). While all of these workers display a bright {UV}-reflecting abdominal tip, the colours in other body parts differ strongly to the eyes of avian predators. The hypothesis that foragers from the non-native bumblebee populations, which differ in coloration from the local native population, would suffer higher predation risk was not upheld. In contrast, in one location (Sardinia) the native population had the highest loss rate. The consistent population rank order we found in terms of forager losses indicates that such losses are more prominently affected by factors other than the familiarity of local predators with aposematic colour patterns.},

	abstract = {Many species of birds exhibit brilliant ornamental plumage, yet most research on the function and evolution of plumage has been confined to the breeding season. In the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, a long-distance Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the acquisition of a winter territory in high-quality habitat advances spring departure and subsequent arrival on breeding areas, and increases reproductive success and annual survival. Here, we show that males holding winter territories in high-quality, black mangrove habitats in Jamaica have brighter yellow-orange tail feathers than males occupying territories in poor-quality second-growth scrub habitats. Moreover, males arriving on the breeding grounds from higher-quality winter habitats (inferred by stable-carbon isotopes) also had brighter tail feathers. Because behavioral dominance plays an important role in the acquisition of winter territories, plumage brightness may also be related to fighting ability and the acquisition and maintenance of territories in high-quality habitat. These results highlight the need for further research on the relationships between plumage coloration, behavior, and the ecology of over-wintering migratory birds.},

This article outlines four grades of ‘colour vision’ that can be related to the behavioural uses of spectral information, and perhaps to the underlying mechanisms. In the first, even without an (image-forming) eye, simple organisms can compare photoreceptor signals to locate a desired light environment. At the next grade, chromatic mechanisms along with spatial vision guide innate preferences for objects such as food or mates; this is sometimes described as wavelength-specific behaviour. Here, we compare the capabilities of di- and trichromatic vision, and ask why some animals have more than three spectral types of receptors. Behaviours guided by innate preferences are then distinguished from a grade that allows learning, in part because the ability to learn an arbitrary colour is evidence for a neural representation of colour. The fourth grade concerns colour appearance rather than colour difference: for instance, the distinction between hue and saturation, and colour categorization. These higher-level phenomena are essential to human colour perception but poorly known in animals, and we suggest how they can be studied. Finally, we observe that awareness of colour and colour qualia cannot be easily tested in animals.},

	abstract = {1. The courtship behavior of the sulfur butterflies, Colias eurytheme and C. philodice (Lepidoptera, Pieridae), was studied in the field and in large outdoor flight cages. Experiments were performed to investigate the nature of releasers of male courtship behavior and to determine the basis of conspecific mate recognition by females. 2. The courtship of these species is extremely brief and does not involve the elaborate displays characteristic of many other butterflies. Mature females employ a mate-refusal posture (Fig. 10) to effect mate selection against, and insure reproductive isolation from, non-conspecific males. The same behavior is also employed by unreceptive females in response to conspecific males. 3. Males rely on visual cues to locate and identify females. They respond to paper dummies of the appropriate color (Figs. 15 and 16) and attempt to mate with them (Fig. 7B). No chemical stimuli are necessary to elicit this behavior. The most attractive dummies closely match the yellowish green, ultraviolet-absorbing color of the female ventral hind wing (Fig. 17). Ultraviolet reflection added to an otherwise attractive dummy (Fig. 18A) strongly inhibits male approaches (Fig. 18B). One function of the ultraviolet reflection of male C. eurytheme (Fig. 1) is its use as an inhibitory signal directed to other males. This signal is displayed by individual males to communicate their sex to others, as well as by males in copulo to inhibit courtship attempts of intruders (Fig. 11). 4. Visible color differences between C. eurytheme (orange) and C. philodice (yellow) males play no role in mate selection by females of either species (Table 8). The ultraviolet reflection difference between male C. eurytheme (reflecting) and male C. philodice (absorbing) (Figs. 1 and 8) is used as a mate-recognition signal by females of C. eurytheme and in this way functions as a component of the system of isolating mechanisms in this species. C. philodice females do not respond to ultraviolet reflection patterns in any way and appear not to use any visual stimuli in mate selection (Table 8). 5. Females of both species rely on chemical cues for conspecific mate recognition. The chemical signals are not associated with so-called 'androconial' scales (Fig. 19) located in the black borders of the male wings. These scales are not necessary for successful courtship (Table 7) and no sexual function can presently be ascribed to them. For these and other reasons, we suggest that the term 'androconia' not be used for the black border scales of male Colias. No species-recognition pheromones are associated with the dorsal discal region of the male's wings (Table 6), but olfactory signals may be associated with their ventral surfaces, the anterior or posterior margins of their dorsal surfaces, the legs, or the body. 6. All male F1 hybrids are ultraviolet-absorbing. F1 hybrid females, derived from crosses between female C. eurytheme and male C. philodice, display the same mate-selection behavior as is characteristic for butterflies of their paternal parents' species (Table 4).},

	abstract = {Mating behaviour affects reproductive isolation and phenotypic differentiation. In Lake Tanganyika, the cichlid fish Tropheus moorii diversified into numerous, currently allopatric colour variants. Allopatric isolation is periodically interrupted by dispersal and secondary contact during lake level fluctuations, making long-term differentiation partly dependent on assortative mating. Laboratory experiments with two moderately distinct morphs revealed assortative female preferences in one (Nakaku), but random mate choice in the other morph (Mbita). No discrimination was apparent between two subtly differentiated morphs (Chimba and Moliro). Tested against each other in a previous study, the highly distinct Moliro and Nakaku exhibited strong assortative preferences. The correlation between colour pattern similarity and mate discrimination suggests that allopatry and philopatric behaviour are less crucial for the maintenance of differentiation between highly distinct morphs than for more similar morphs. Interestingly, the asymmetric isolation in one pair of morphs is congruent with a pattern of unidirectional mitochondrial introgression between populations.},

We first blocked putative androconial organs on the fore- and hindwings of males, while also manipulating the ability of females to perceive chemical signals via their antenna. We found that male chemical signals were emitted by both fore- and hindwing pairs and that they play an important role in female choice. We subsequently tested the relative importance of these chemical cues versus visual cues, previously identified for this species, and found that they play an equally important role in female choice in our laboratory setting. In addition, females will mate with males with only one signal present and blocking both androconial organs on males seems to interfere with male to male recognition. We discuss the possible functions of these signals and how this bimodal system may be used in intra- and interspecific mate evaluation.},

Cl declines rapidly kith male age, particularly when males are repeatedly mated. Wolbachia from a Canton S line that was previously reported as not causing {CI} does in fact induce {CI} when young males are used in crosses. albeit at a weaker level than in other D. melanogaster strains. The strain differences in Cl expression are due to host background effects rather than differences in Wolbachia strains. These results highlight the importance Of undertaking crosses with a range of male ages and nuclear backgrounds before ascribing particular host phenotypes to Wolbachia strains.},

	abstract = {A ‘dark morph’ melanic strain of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, was studied for its atypical, heightened resistance to infection with the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana. We show that these insects exhibit multiple intraspecific immunity and physiological traits that distinguish them from a non-melanic, fungus-susceptible morph. The melanic and non-melanic morphs were geographical variants that had evolved different, independent defence strategies. Melanic morphs exhibit a thickened cuticle, higher basal expression of immunity- and stress-management-related genes, higher numbers of circulating haemocytes, upregulated cuticle phenoloxidase ({PO}) activity concomitant with conidial invasion, and an enhanced capacity to encapsulate fungal particles. These insects prioritize specific augmentations to those frontline defences that are most likely to encounter invading pathogens or to sustain damage. Other immune responses that target late-stage infection, such as haemolymph lysozyme and {PO} activities, do not contribute to fungal tolerance. The net effect is increased larval survival times, retarded cuticular fungal penetration and a lower propensity to develop haemolymph infections when challenged naturally (topically) and by injection. In the absence of fungal infection, however, the heavy defence investments made by melanic insects result in a lower biomass, decreased longevity and lower fecundity in comparison with their non-melanic counterparts. Although melanism is clearly correlated with increased fungal resistance, the costly mechanisms enabling this protective trait constitute more than just a colour change.},

One possibility is that ornamental traits convey different sets of information about the quality of the sender to the receiver. The colourful, pigmented feathers of male birds seem to meet the predictions of this hypothesis. Evidence suggests that carotenoid pigmentation reflects the nutritional condition of males during moult, whereas in many instances melanin pigmentation is a reliable indicator of social status. However, as of yet there have been no experimental tests to determine how these two ornament types respond to the same form of environmental stress. In this study we tested the effect of endoparasitic infection by intestinal coccidians (Isospora sp.) on tho expression of both carotenoid- and melanin-based ornamental coloration in captive male American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). We found that the carotenoid-based plumage and bill coloration of parasitized males was less saturated than that developed by unparasitized males, but that the brightness and size of melanin-based black caps did not differ between the groups. These findings provide the most robust empirical support to date for the notion that carotenoid and melanin ornaments reveal different information to conspecifics.},

	abstract = {The allocation of resources to reproduction and survival is a central question of studies of life history evolution. Usually, increased allocation to current reproduction is paid in terms of reduced future reproduction and/or decreased survival. However, the proximal mechanisms underlying the cost of reproduction are poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that increased susceptibility to oxidative stress might be one of such proximate links between reproduction and self-maintenance. Organisms possess a range of antioxidant defenses, including endogenously produced molecules (e.g., enzymes) and compounds ingested with food (e.g., carotenoids). If reproductive effort increases the production of reactive oxygen species, the availability of antioxidant defenses may partly or fully counteract the free-radical damages. One could, therefore, expect that the trade-off between reproduction and oxidative stress is modulated by the availability of antioxidant defenses. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches. We manipulated reproductive effort by either allowing or preventing pairs to breed. Within each breeding or non-breeding group, the availability of antioxidant compounds was manipulated by supplementing or not supplementing the drinking water with carotenoids. We found that although birds in the breeding and non-breeding groups did not differ in their resistance to oxidative stress (the breakdown of red blood cells submitted to a controlled free-radical attack), one aspect of breeding effort (i.e., the number of eggs laid by birds in both breeding and non-breeding groups) was negatively correlated with resistance to oxidative stress only in birds that did not benefit from a carotenoid-supplemented diet. This result therefore suggests that carotenoid availability can modulate the trade-off between reproduction and resistance to oxidative stress.},

In a global context of growing anthropogenic disturbances on natural and semi-natural ecosystems, the only conservation of those ecosystems is not sufficient anymore. The ecological restoration may hence be an essential complement to conservation. The paper consists in a synthesis of scientific literature dedicated to the concepts of ecological restoration. We tackle the notion of restoration objectives, notably through the ecological reference. Besides the delimitation of clear objectives, the reference will enable the evaluation of restoration efforts by the use of indicators. The indicators may also provide information related to the attributes of the restored ecosystem and/or the followed ecological trajectory. Potential constraints faced by species through ecological filters could hence be detected and compensation measures could be proposed.},

	abstract = {Many vertebrates use carotenoid-based signals in social or sexual interactions. Honest signalling via carotenoids implies some limitation of carotenoid-based colour expression among phenotypes in the wild, and at least five limiting proximate mechanisms have been hypothesized. Limitation may arise by carotenoid-availability, genetic constraints, body condition, parasites, or detrimental effects of carotenoids. An understanding of the relative importance of the five mechanisms is relevant in the context of natural and sexual selection acting on signal evolution. In an experimental field study with carotenoid supplementation, simultaneous cross-fostering, manipulation of brood size and ectoparasite load, we investigated the relative importance of these mechanisms for the variation in carotenoid-based coloration of nestling great tits (Parus major). Carotenoid-based plumage coloration was significantly related to genetic origin of nestlings, and was enhanced both in carotenoid-supplemented nestlings, and nestlings raised in reduced broods. We found a tendency for ectoparasite-induced limitation of colour expression and no evidence for detrimental effects of carotenoids on growth pattern, mortality and recruitment of nestlings to the local breeding population. Thus, three of the five proposed mechanisms can generate individual variation in the expression of carotenoid-based plumage coloration in the wild and thus could maintain honesty in a trait potentially used for signalling of individual quality.},

Nucleotide sequence data from 16S {rDNA} and a Wolbachia surface protein coding sequence and cytoplasmic incompatibility assays identify four distinct Wolbachia strains: {wHa}, {wRi}, {wMa}. and It Au. The levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility between six lines carrying these strains of bacteria and three control lines without, bacteria are characterized. Flies infected with {wHa} and {wRi} are bidirectionally incompatible, acid males that carry either strain can only successfully produce normal numbers of offspring with females carrying the same bacterial strain. Males infected with {wAu} do not express incompatibility. Males infected with the {wMa} strain express intermediate incompatibility when mated to females with no bacteria and no incompatibility with females with any other Wolbachia strain. We conduct polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism assays to distinguish the strain of Wolbachia and the mitochondrial haplotype to survey populations for each type and associations between them. Drosophila simulans is known to have three major mitochondrial haplotypes ({siI}, {siII}, and {siIII}) and two subtypes ({siIIA} and {siIIB}). All infected lines of the {siI} haplotype carry {wHa}, {wNo}, or both; {wMa} and {wNo} are closely related and it is not clear whether they are distinct strains or variants of the same strain. Infected lines with the {siIIA} haplotype harbor {wRi} and the {siIIB} haplotype carries {wAu}. The {wMa} infection is found in {siIII} haplotype lines. The phenotypic expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility and its relation to between-population differences in frequencies of Wolbachia infection are discussed.},

Brighter coloured ornaments are preferred during mate choice and are thought to signal resistance to parasites, immune capacity and health status. As the colouration of integuments is a dynamic trait, changes in colouration potentially reflect changes in. individual condition. The bill of the male Common Blackbird (or Blackbird, Turdus merula) has become a model for studying the implications of carotenoid-coloured integuments in birds, and Blackbird bill colouration has been found to be related to reproductive ability and immune capacity. However, the relationship between bill colouration and parasites and health in this species remains unclear. We have analysed the association between bill colouration, parasites (blood and intestinal parasites) and health status indicators (standard haematological and plasma biochemistry variables) in free-ranging male Blackbirds during the breeding season. Bill colouration was found to be related to body condition, health status, stress and hydration and nutritional status, but the presence or load of the parasite groups studied was not found to be related to bill colouration. Moreover, parasites showed no clear aggregation patterns. Our results suggest that certain physiological constraints rather than parasite infection are the main cause of variability in the colouration of male Blackbird bills.},

Here I show that females of the sexually dichromatic species Hypolimnas bolina prefer conspecific males that possess bright iridescent blue/ultraviolet dorsal ornamentation. In separate field and enclosure experiments, using both dramatic and graded wing colour manipulations, I demonstrate that a moderate qualitative reduction in signal brightness and chromaticity has the same consequences as removing the signal entirely. These findings validate a long-held hypothesis, and argue for the importance of intra- versus interspecific selection as the driving force behind the exaggeration of bright, iridescent butterfly colour patterns.},

Crab spiders, Thomisus spectabilis, position themselves on flowers to prey on pollinators such as honeybees, Apis mellifera. We gave both honeybees and crab spiders the choice between two randomly chosen white Chrysanthemum frutescens, including olfactory signals in one experiment and excluding odor in a second experiment. When olfactory signals were included, crab spiders and honeybees clearly preferred the same flower out of a pair. However, agreement level was at chance in the absence of olfactory signals. We also analyzed the visual flower characteristics that might influence the decision of the animals. Neither the size of flowers (diameter of flower and diameter of reproductive flower center) nor the reflectance properties (receptor excitation values in ultraviolet, blue, and green; overall brightness) influenced the choices of crab spiders and honeybees. Therefore, odor seems to be the floral signal that bees use to identify high-quality flowers and that crab spiders exploit to encounter honeybees.},

	abstract = {Aposematic conspicuous coloration consists of one or a few bright colours, often in combination with a black defined internal pattern. The function of conspicuousness in aposematism has been ascribed to signal efficacy, based on experimental evidence involving prey items with uniform colour that contrast with the background. Although there are several hypotheses about the existence of internal contrasts within warning coloration, little experimental evidence has been presented. Here we used domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, to investigate the relative importance of colour and pattern in avoidance learning. Birds in two groups were first trained to discriminate between a grey positive stimulus and a cyan negative stimulus with either black dots or stripes. Pieces of mealworms, untreated and palatable or made unpalatable by soaking in quinine were used as reinforcers. Secondly, to determine what birds had attended to when learning the discrimination, colour and/or pattern, we compared how they generalized their avoidance of the 'training stimulus' to either a 'colour only' or 'pattern only' stimulus. The chicks learned to avoid the unpalatable prey items but showed no difference in behaviour depending on the type of pattern presented. The generalization test showed that birds avoided the novel 'colour only' stimulus at least as much as the 'training stimulus', and did not generalize their avoidance to the 'pattern only' stimulus. We conclude that birds do not necessarily attend to complex patterns when learning a warning signal, and domestic chicks primarily learn a bright colour rather than an equally novel conspicuous black pattern.

We evaluated the function of antipredator calls in 10 species of passerines by measuring the acoustic directionality of these calls in response to experimental presentations of a model predator. Acoustic directionality quantifies the radiation pattern of vocalizations and may provide evidence about the receiver of these calls. We predicted that antipredator calls would have a lower directionality if they function to communicate with surrounding conspecifics, and a higher directionality and aimed at the receiver if they function to communicate with the predator. Our results support both of these functions. Overall, the birds produce antipredator calls that have a relatively low directionality, suggesting that the calls radiate in many directions to alert conspecifics. However, birds in some species increase the directionality of their calls when facing the predator. They can even direct their calls towards the predator when facing lateral to it-effectively vocalizing sideways towards the predator. These results suggest that antipredator calls in some species are used to communicate both to conspecifics and to predators, and that birds adjust the directionality of their calls with remarkable sophistication according to the context in which they are used.},

	abstract = {Island biogeography has provided fundamental hypotheses in population genetics, ecology and evolutionary biology. Insular populations usually face different feeding conditions, predation pressure, intraspecific and interspecific competition than continental populations. This so-called island syndrome can promote the evolution of specific phenotypes like a small (or large) body size and a light (or dark) colouration as well as influence the evolution of sexual dimorphism. To examine whether insularity leads to phenotypic differentiation in a consistent way in a worldwide-distributed nonmigratory species, we compared body size, body shape and colouration between insular and continental barn owl (Tyto alba) populations by controlling indirectly for phylogeny. This species is suitable because it varies in pheomelanin-based colouration from reddish-brown to white, and it displays eumelanic black spots for which the number and size vary between individuals, populations and species. Females are on average darker pheomelanic and display more and larger eumelanic spots than males. Our results show that on islands barn owls exhibited smaller and fewer eumelanic spots and lighter pheomelanic colouration, and shorter wings than on continents. Sexual dimorphism in pheomelanin-based colouration was less pronounced on islands than continents (i.e. on islands males tended to be as pheomelanic as females), and on small islands owls were redder pheomelanic and smaller in size than owls living on larger islands. Sexual dimorphism in the size of eumelanic spots was more pronounced (i.e. females displayed much larger spots than males) in barn owls living on islands located further away from a continent. Our study indicates that insular conditions drive the evolution towards a lower degree of eumelanism, smaller body size and affects the evolution of sexual dichromatism in melanin-based colour traits. The effect of insularity was more pronounced on body size and shape than on melanic traits.},

	abstract = {Phengaris (=Maculinea) arion is an endangered social parasite of Myrmica ants, and for a very long time was considered as specific to Myrmica sabuleti. Previous studies carried out in Poland suggested some discrepancies within this assumption, and therefore a much more intensive survey was undertaken. The host ant use of P. arion was studied at five sites in different types of biotopes in Poland, i.e. xerothermal grasslands where Thymus pulegioides was used as a larval food plant by the butterfly, and more or less sandy biotopes with Thymus serpyllum. Altogether nine Myrmica species were recorded, and considerable variation in species composition and density of nests was recorded. At four localities M. sabuleti proved to be the most common ant. A total of 529 Myrmica nests were examined, and only 20 of them contained larvae and pupae of P. arion. Host ants belonged to five different species, i.e. M. sabuleti, Myrmica scabrinodis, Myrmica schencki, Myrmica lobicornis and Myrmica hellenica. Only at one site ({NE} Poland) was a significant heterogeneity in parasitation rates among Myrmica species detected. M. lobicornis was the most often infested ant there, which may suggest local specialisation of the butterfly. Overall low parasitism rates may explain the vulnerability of P. arion in Central Europe but further studies are also necessary.},

	abstract = {The structural colour of the neon tetra is distinguishable from those of, e.g., butterfly wings and bird feathers, because it can change in response to the light intensity of the surrounding environment. This fact clearly indicates the variability of the colour-producing microstructures. It has been known that an iridophore of the neon tetra contains a few stacks of periodically arranged light-reflecting platelets, which can cause multilayer optical interference phenomena. As a mechanism of the colour variability, the Venetian blind model has been proposed, in which the light-reflecting platelets are assumed to be tilted during colour change, resulting in a variation in the spacing between the platelets. In order to quantitatively evaluate the validity of this model, we have performed a detailed optical study of a single stack of platelets inside an iridophore. In particular, we have prepared a new optical system that can simultaneously measure both the spectrum and direction of the reflected light, which are expected to be closely related to each other in the Venetian blind model. The experimental results and detailed analysis are found to quantitatively verify the model.},

As time elapsed, maximum percent reflectance (R-max) decreased across all anaesthetic methods and species, suggesting that measurements should be taken immediately after capture and anaesthetization. With increasing light intensity, R-max increased significantly, suggesting that measurements should be taken under natural ambient conditions when possible. Finally, we found that anaesthetizing fish using an ice bath produced significantly higher R-max than using either {MS}-222 (tricaine methanesulphonate) or clove oil ( eugenol). However, the highest proportion of ultraviolet ({UV}) colouration was recorded while fish were anaesthetized with clove oil.

	abstract = {After years of investigation into the function of sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, researchers are beginning to understand how bright plumage colour in birds acts as an intraspecific signal. This work has focused primarily on pigment-based ornaments because they are highly variable in patch size, hue and brightness for some species. In contrast, structurally based ornaments have been little studied, in part because they do not appear to be as variable as pigment-based ornaments. We investigated a structurally based plumage ornament in a wild population of blue grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), a sexually dimorphic passerine. We report plumage variation that extends into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The pattern of covariation between four out of five elements of plumage variation suggests that structurally based ornamentation is pushed towards extreme expression of the trait as predicted by the sexual selection theory. The 'bluest' birds have the highest percentage of blue feathers on the body. These ornamental feathers reflect light maximally at the shortest wavelengths (ultraviolet), with the greatest intensity and the greatest contrast. Age may have some effect on expression of blueness. In addition, plumage variables are correlated with growth bars in tail feathers (a record of nutritional condition during moult in a non-ornamental trait). This suggests that the ornament is partially condition dependent. Thus, blue plumage in male grosbeaks may serve as an honest indicator of age and quality.},

	abstract = {Structural colours, the most intense, reflective and pure colours in nature, are generated when light is scattered by complex nanostructures. Metallic structural colours are widespread among modern insects and can be preserved in their fossil counterparts, but it is unclear whether the colours have been altered during fossilization, and whether the absence of colours is always real. To resolve these issues, we investigated fossil beetles from five Cenozoic biotas. Metallic colours in these specimens are generated by an epicuticular multi-layer reflector; the fidelity of its preservation correlates with that of other key cuticular ultrastructures. Where these other ultrastructures are well preserved in non-metallic fossil specimens, we can infer that the original cuticle lacked a multi-layer reflector; its absence in the fossil is not a preservational artefact. Reconstructions of the original colours of the fossils based on the structure of the multi-layer reflector show that the preserved colours are offset systematically to longer wavelengths; this probably reflects alteration of the refractive index of the epicuticle during fossilization. These findings will allow the former presence, and original hue, of metallic structural colours to be identified in diverse fossil insects, thus providing critical evidence of the evolution of structural colour in this group.},

	abstract = {Many animals bear colors and patterns to reduce the risk of predation from visually hunting predators, including warning colors, camouflage, and mimicry. In addition, various species possess paired circular features often called "eyespots," which may intimidate or startle predators preventing or postponing an attack. Most explanations for how eyespots work assert that they mimic the eyes of the predators own enemies. However, recent work has indicated that spots may reduce the risk of predation based purely on how conspicuous they are to a predator's visual system. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial prey marked with stimuli of various shapes, numbers, and sizes, presented to avian predators in the field, to distinguish between the eye mimicry and conspicuousness theories. In 3 experiments, we find that the features which make effective antipredator wing markings are large size and higher numbers of spots. Stimuli with circles survived no better than those marked with other conspicuous shapes such as bars, and changing the spatial construction of the spots to increase the level of eye mimicry had no effect on the protective value of the spots. These experiments support other recent work indicating that conspicuousness, and not eye mimicry, is important in promoting avoidance behavior in predators and that eyespots on real animals need not necessarily, as most accounts claim, mimic the eyes of other animals.},

These hypotheses were evaluated by investigating mate locating behavior in Hypolimnas bolina, a territorial species that is naturally subject to variation in population density and weather conditions. Male behavior was charted throughout the day during a period of high population density at art encounter site in tropical Australia. Perching was the primary tactic, although a small proportion of individuals patrolled nonaggressively in the afternoon. Population-level male behavior failed to support predictions drawn from either the "territory economics" or "thermal constraint" hypotheses. First, the proportion of perching males and the number of aggressive conspecific interactions (per male) increased with increasing male density at the site. Second few males patrolled at the honest, brightest rime of day (approximately midday), and the diel distribution of perchers did not emulate the "U-shaped" distribution shown by the occurrence of dorsal basking behavior. These results show that perching in this species is not a suboptimal tactic employed when temperatures constrain flight activity but may represent the best method of locating receptive females. Ar this stage the reproductive significance of the observed patrolling behavior remains obscure.},

In the present experiment, we describe the performance of zebrafish in a test of attentional set formation. The fish were initially trained on a two-choice colour discrimination. Upon reaching acquisition criterion, the reinforced alternative was switched to the previously unreinforced alternative. Again, upon reaching criterion, the cues were replaced with a novel pair of colours (intra-dimensional shift) and reversed again on reaching criteria. We found that zebrafish show a steady decrease in trials-to-criteria over the four phases of the experiment, suggesting that they are forming and maintaining an attentional set, as has previously been demonstrated with mammals. Reversal learning deficits have been implicated in a variety of human psychological disorders (e.g., disorders of impulse control) and as such, we propose that performance of zebrafish in this procedure may represent a useful comparative model to complement existing rodent models.

Wolbachia prevalence (ranging from 0\% to 100\% of sampled females) was highly variable among populations. All three Wolbachia strains previously observed in A. vulgare were present ({wVulC}, {wVulM} and {wVulP}) with {wVulC} being the most prevalent (nine of 13 populations). The host showed a genetic structure on five microsatellite loci that is compatible with isolation by distance. The strong genetic structure observed on host {mtDNA} was correlated with Wolbachia prevalence: three mitotypes were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the three strains of Wolbachia. Neutrality tests showed that the {mtDNA} polymorphism is not neutral, and we thus suggest that this unusual pattern of {mtDNA} polymorphism found in A. vulgare was due to Wolbachia.},

	abstract = {In monogamous bird species, male parental investment may influence offspring fitness and females may gain advantages through mating with males providing extensive paternal care. However, paternal care is a benefit that can only be assessed indirectly because mate choice precedes paternal activities. Individual quality and age, both signalled by morphological characteristics, may reflect parental abilities. Because they may reflect individual foraging abilities, carotenoid-based colorations have been proposed to honestly signal parental quality. The blackbird (Turdus merula), a socially monogamous species, exhibits biparental care and males show bills that vary from pale yellow to orange due to carotenoid pigments. In this study, we investigated whether male bill colour and age are associated with parental ability. Our results suggest that males with more orange bills and older males are better fathers. Indeed, male visit rate increased with their bill colour index independently of age, and brood condition was higher for adult males, compared to yearlings, independently of bill colour. Overall, the number of fledglings produced was positively influenced by both the age of males and the colour intensity of their bills. Males with more orange bills and adults had a greater number of fledglings and these males also had higher levels of prolactin, a hormone known to promote parental care. This latter finding suggests that prolactin may be the link between carotenoid based colorations and the intensity of paternal effort. Thus, male bill colour seems to honestly reveal male physiological adjustment to paternal activities.},

We experimentally accelerated the moult speed of a group of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) by exposing them to a rapidly decreasing photoperiod and compared the spectral characteristics of their structural feather colours with those of control birds. Blue tits were sexually dimorphic on the {UV}/blue crown and on the white cheek feathers. Moult speed, however, dramatically reduced brightness and the saturation only on the {UV}/blue crown feathers, whereas structural white on the cheek feathers was basically unaffected by moult speed. Given that the time available for moulting is usually confined to the period between the end of the breeding season and migration or wintering, {UV}/blue colours, but not structural white, may convey long-term information about an individual's performance during the previous breeding season. The trade-off between fast moulting and structural colour expression may represent a previously unrecognized selective advantage for early-breeding birds.},

However, despite its potential adaptive value, the insect food searching strategy and cues used to search are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the ability of hymenopteran Venturia canescens females to associate food to a visual cue. To broaden the scope of our results, experiments were performed with both arrhenotokous (sexual) and thelytokous (asexual) individuals. The wasps showed innate attraction for yellow and orange stimuli when presented versus blue stimuli. When trained to associate a food reward with one of the attractive colours (orange), they significantly moved from a distance towards the colour previously associated with food. The choice of the innately preferred colour (yellow) was not modified by associative learning. In the context of food foraging, this study is the first to show associative learning using visual stimuli in a parasitoid and active choice of this colour. This ability gives new insights concerning potential food sources for V. canescens in the field, since flowers are sugar sources, which emit colour signals.},

However, in many cases, humans cannot detect colour differences that are discernible to birds and it is therefore necessary to employ objective methods that contemplate the characteristics of the avian visual system for the study of plumage coloration. An understudied property of feather coloration is the occurrence of fluorescence, which has been described almost exclusively in parrots from the Eastern Hemisphere using non-objective methods and has been attributed to yellow pigments that are only present in psittacids. In this study, we explore fluorescence and sexual dichromatism through objective and quantitative methods in the plumage of a Neotropical species, the blue-winged parrotlet Forpus xanthopterygius. We measured plumage reflectance and fluorescence emission on museum skins using spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry, respectively. The reflectance analysis revealed the presence of ultraviolet sexual dichromatism that adds to the differences in the visible range of wavelengths that are detectable by humans. The spectrofluorometric analysis showed that fluorescence is indeed present in this species, both in green plumage patches, where fluorescent pigments are presumably located, and in the blue rump of males, where colour is considered to be purely structurally based. The sexes differed in the intensity and wavelength of their fluorescence emission, representing the first finding of fluorescence sexual dichromatism in birds.},

Several recent theoretical models of sympatric speciation by disruptive sexual selection were tailored to apply to African cichlids. Most of this work concludes that the genetic architecture of female preference and male trait is a key determinant of the likelihood of disruptive sexual selection to result in speciation. We investigated the genetic architecture controlling male nuptial colouration in a sympatric sibling species pair of cichlid fish from Lake Victoria, which differ conspicuously in male colouration and female mating preferences for these. We estimated that the difference between the species in male nuptial red colouration is controlled by a minimum number of two to four genes with significant epistasis and dominance effects. Yellow colouration appears to be controlled by one gene with complete dominance. The two colours appear to be epistatically linked. Knowledge on how male colouration segregates in hybrid generations and on the number of genes controlling differences between species can help us assess whether assumptions made in simulation models of sympatric speciation by sexual selection are realistic. In the particular case of the two sister species that we studied a small number of genes causing major differences in male colouration may have facilitated the divergence in male colouration associated with speciation.},

Species capable of physiological colour change may alter their coloration in response to ecological conditions. The Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, is capable of actively changing its body coloration. In the present study, we investigated colour change in this gecko as a function of background, temperature, and light. Our results demonstrate that the Moorish gecko indeed changes its dorsal colour in response to changes in environmental conditions. By contrast to several other reptilian species, this rapid colour change does not appear to be associated with thermoregulation. Background matching, however, did appear to be a prominent function, although illumination appears to be an essential trigger.

We consider a reaction system in which polymerization is possible by the addition of an activated monomer to the end of a chain. We suppose that a small fraction of polymers longer than some minimum length L have the ability to act as polymerase ribozymes. Polymerization can occur spontaneously at a slow rate and can also be catalyzed by polymerase ribozymes, if these ribozymes exist. The system contains autocatalytic feedback: increasing the polymerization rate causes the ribozyme concentration to increase, which causes the polymerization rate to further increase. For an infinite volume, the dynamics are deterministic. There are two stable states: a 'dead' state with a very low concentration of ribozymes and a polymerization rate almost equal to the spontaneous rate, and a 'living' state with a high concentration of ribozymes and a high rate of polymerization occurring via ribozyme catalysis. In a finite volume, such as the interior of a lipid vesicle or other small compartment, the reaction dynamics is stochastic and concentration fluctuations can occur. Using a stochastic simulation, we show that if a small number of ribozymes is initially formed spontaneously, this can be enough to drive the system from the dead to the living state where ribozyme-catalyzed synthesis of large numbers of additional ribozymes occurs. This transition occurs most easily in volumes of intermediate size.},

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based ornamental coloration has long been proposed to honestly signal quality due to its dependence on individual condition. Because migration can be one of the most stressful periods of an animal's annual cycle, developing colourful plumage may be particularly challenging for species in which migration and moult periods overlap or occur sequentially. The purpose of this study was to investigate pigmentary and condition-dependent bases of carotenoid colour variation in a small migratory passerine, the golden-crowned kinglet Regulus satrapa (Family Regulidae). We captured 186 male and female kinglets of various ages during fall migration in southwestern Ontario, Canada and recorded arrival date, body condition index, fat and pectoral muscle scores, wing mite infestation, and feather growth rate as measures of condition. We quantified crown coloration using reflectance spectrometry and analyzed feather carotenoids using high-performance liquid chromatography. Yellow crown feathers of female kinglets contained only yellow hydroxycarotenoids, whereas orange feathers of males harboured a suite of eight carotenoid pigments. Males with longer wavelength orange crown hues deposited greater concentrations of ketocarotenoids, especially canthaxanthin. Female kinglets with longer wavelength crown hues and males with longer wavelength crown hues and more saturated crown coloration left for migration earlier in the year. Females with longer wavelength crown hues had fewer feather mites and tended to be in better condition. However, male kinglets with more saturated coloration possessed smaller pectoral muscles. This is the first study to identify plumage carotenoids in this North American bird family and to determine the pigmentary basis for both inter-and intrasexual colour variation. Our results provide further support for the condition-dependence of carotenoid coloration and suggest that ornamental elaboration in both sexes may encode information about fall condition and migratory performance.},

	abstract = {The signalling hypothesis of eggshell colouration in birds posits that females of species with blue-green eggs signal their phenotypic quality or the quality of their eggs to their mates through deposition of the antioxidant biliverdin as pigment. Males respond by investing more in the offspring. Through a cross-fostering experiment where we have exchanged whole clutches between pairs of pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca nests, we managed to break potential associations between female quality and clutch chromaticity. We show that males respond to incubated clutches with more variable and higher peak values in blue-green chroma through a higher proportional investment in nestling provisioning on day 4 of the nestling period, when males invest more heavily than females in provisioning. More variable clutches show higher peak chroma values. We also show that egg colour during the two-week incubation period has a significant effect, which is not found for the colour of eggs during the laying period. Finally, the proportion of male provisioning visits affects negatively female brooding effort and nestling mortality, and thereby has positive effects on female fitness. Blue-green chroma in the pied flycatcher functions as a signal of female or clutch quality to males which respond by adjusting their relative investment with respect to total pair effort.},

	abstract = {The non-iridescent structural colours of avian feather barbs are produced by coherent light scattering from amorphous (i.e. quasi-ordered) nanostructures of \{beta\}-keratin and air in the medullary cells of feather barb rami. Known barb nanostructures belong to two distinct morphological classes. Channel' nanostructures consist of \{beta\}-keratin bars and air channels of elongate, tortuous and twisting forms. Spherical' nanostructures consist of highly spherical air cavities that are surrounded by thin \{beta\}-keratin bars and sometimes interconnected by tiny passages. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observe that the colour-producing channel-type nanostructures of medullary \{beta\}-keratin in feathers of the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna, Psittacidae) develop by intracellular self-assembly; the process proceeds in the absence of any biological prepattern created by the cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum or cellular intermediate filaments. We examine the hypothesis that the shape and size of these self-assembled, intracellular nanostructures are determined by phase separation of \{beta\}-keratin protein from the cytoplasm of the cell. The shapes of a broad sample of colour-producing channel-type nanostructures from nine avian species are very similar to those self-assembled during the phase separation of an unstable mixture, a process called spinodal decomposition ({SD}). In contrast, the shapes of a sample of spherical-type nanostructures from feather barbs of six species show a poor match to {SD}. However, spherical nanostructures show a strong morphological similarity to morphologies produced by phase separation of a metastable mixture, called nucleation and growth. We propose that colour-producing, intracellular, spongy medullary \{beta\}-keratin nanostructures develop their characteristic sizes and shapes by phase separation during protein polymerization. We discuss the possible role of capillary flow through drying of medullary cells in the development of the hollow morphology of typical and spongy feather medullary cells.},

Most often colour patterns are thought to signal visual stimuli; so, their presence in subterranean taxa is perplexing. We evaluate the adaptive nature of colour patterns in nearly a third of all known species of caecilians, an order of amphibians most of which live in tropical soils and leaf litter. We found that certain colour pattern elements in caecilians can be explained based on characteristics concerning above-ground movement. Our study implies that certain caecilian colour patterns have convergently evolved under selection and we hypothesize their function most likely to be a synergy of aposematism and crypsis, related to periods when individuals move overground. In a wider context, our results suggest that very little exposure to daylight is required to evolve and maintain a varied array of colour patterns in animal skin.},

These subspecies are allopatric except for two known regions of sympatry in Texas and Mexico. We demonstrate that populations of D. v. virgifera, with the exception of two populations in southern Arizona, are infected with a strain of Wolbachia. Populations of D. v. zeae are not infected. Treatment of D. v. virgifera with tetracycline eliminated the Wolbachia and removed the reproductive incompatibility. Similar patterns of reproductive incompatibility exist among taxa of the cricket genus Gryllus. Gryllus assimilis, G. integer, G. ovisopis, G. pennsylvanicus, and G. rubens are infected with Wolbachia whereas G. firmus is usually not. Populations of G. rubens and G. ovisopis carry the same Wolbachia strain, which is distinct from that of G. integer. G. pennsylvanicus is infected with two Wolbachia strains, that found in G. rubens and one unique to G. pennsylvanicus. Moreover, a proportion of G. pennsylvanicus individuals harbors both strains. Wolbachia may have influenced speciation in some members of the genus Gryllus by affecting the degree of hybridization between species. Given that Wolbachia infections are relatively common in insects, it is likely that other insect hybrid zones may be influenced by infections with Wolbachia.},

Electron microscopy reveals that the Apollo rhabdom is tiered. The distal tier is composed exclusively of photoreceptors expressing opsins of ultraviolet or blue-absorbing visual pigments, and the proximal tier consists of photoreceptors expressing opsins of green or red-absorbing visual pigments. This organization is unique because the distal tier of other known butterflies contains two green-sensitive photoreceptors, which probably function in improving spatial and/or motion vision. Interspecific comparison suggests that the Apollo rhabdom retains an ancestral tiered pattern with some modification to enhance its colour vision towards the long-wavelength region of the spectrum.},

Our results indicate that the total diversity of land-plant megafossil genera and species across the Permian/Triassic boundary ({PTB}) of South China underwent a progressive decline from the early Late Perm:an (Wuchiapingian) to the Early-Middle Triassic. In contrast, the diversity of land-plant microfossil genera exhibited only a small fluctuation across the {PTB} of South China, showing an increase at the {PTB}. Overall, land plants across the {PTB} of South China show a greater stability in diversity dynamics than marine faunas. The highest extinction rate (90.91\%) and the lowest origination rate (18.18\%) of land-plant megafossil genera occurred at the early Early Triassic (Induan), but the temporal duration of the higher genus extinction rates ({\textgreater}60\%) in land plants was about 23.4 Myr, from the Wuchiapingian to the early Middle Triassic (Anisian), which is longer than that of the coeval marine faunas (3-11 Myr). Moreover, the change of genus turnover rates in land-plant megafossils steadily fluctuated from the late Early Permian to the Late Triassic. More stable diversity and turnover rate as well as longer extinction duration suggest that land plants near the {PTB} of South China may have been involved in a gradual floral reorganization and evolutionary replacement rather than a mass extinction like those in the coeval marine faunas.},

Birds are affected by a variety of parasite taxa, but despite their acknowledged importance in epidemics, the role of bacteria in sexual selection in birds has been poorly investigated. In this study, we examined the expression of colours (red and yellow) in the frontal shield of Moorhens and compared the results with the cloacal bacterial presence. We also measured several health parameters (body condition, {PHA} immune response, heterophils/lymphocytes ratio, haematocrit) that could be related to the expression of frontal shield colour. We found a negative correlation between frontal shield redness and bacterial presence, but red colouration was not related to any other health index. In contrast, the colouration of the yellow portion of the bill was positively related to health (haematocrit and H/L ratio) and immune ({PHA}) parameters, but not to bacterial presence. These correlational data are consistent with the recent hypothesis that different kinds of colouration within an individual may provide different units of information. In the Moorhen, the frontal shields could act as a twofold honest signal of health status, where red reflects cloacal bacterial presence and yellow is related to blood parameters.},

Recent work also showed that both the orange and black coloration of this species can vary in response to individual-level and environmental factors. Here we examine the relationship between wing color and flight performance in captive-reared monarchs using a tethered flight mill apparatus to quantify butterfly flight speed, duration and distance. In three different experiments (totaling 121 individuals) we used image analysis to measure body size and four wing traits among newly-emerged butterflies prior to flight trials: wing area, aspect ratio (length/width), melanism, and orange hue. Results showed that monarchs with darker orange (approaching red) wings flew longer distances than those with lighter orange wings in analyses that controlled for sex and other morphometric traits. This finding is consistent with past work showing that among wild monarchs, those sampled during the fall migration are darker in hue (redder) than non-migratory monarchs. Together, these results suggest that pigment deposition onto wing scales during metamorphosis could be linked with traits that influence flight, such as thorax muscle size, energy storage or metabolism. Our results reinforce an association between wing color and flight performance in insects that is suggested by past studies of wing melansim and seasonal polyphenism, and provide an important starting point for work focused on mechanistic links between insect movement and color.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, the relative contributions of dietary and physiological mechanisms have been questioned of late. However, no studies have concurrently quantified levels of food intake or pigment processing in any species to examine the comparative effects of pigment acquisition and use on integumetary coloration. Here, we studied within- and between-sex patterns of food intake and plasma pigment circulation in the Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to assess how sexually dichromatic, carotenoid-based bill pigmentation serves as an indicator of pigment access in the diet and carotenoid transport through the bloodstream. First, in a food-choice study, we found that males and females did not consume different types or amounts of food, despite dramatic sex differences in bill coloration. Similarly, variability in carotenoid-based bill pigmentation within each sex was uncoupled from levels of food consumption. Next, we used high-performance liquid-chromatography ({HPLC}) to quantify the types and amounts of carotenoids circulating through blood. Male and female Zebra Finches circulated the same four major carotenoid pigments in blood plasma (lutein, zeaxanthin, anhydrolutein, and beta-cryptoxanthin), but males circulated a significantly higher concentration of plasma carotenoids than did females. Within both sexes, individuals that circulated more carotenoid pigments displayed more brightly colored bills. In sum, these results suggest that physiological factors such as pigment transport may play a more important role in shaping variability in carotenoid-based bill coloration in this species than does diet. Future studies should be aimed at identifying the proximate determinants of plasma carotenoid circulation in these birds as well as how circulated pigments are used to produce maximum color displays.},

	abstract = {Traits that enhance attractiveness in one sex may or may not influence attractiveness in the other. In the dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis, outer tail feathers of males and females are all or partly white and form a sharp contrast with the bird's mostly grey plumage. The amount of white in these feathers ('tail white') is greater in males than in females and, as we report here, is greater in birds that have completed a second prebasic moult than in yearlings. During courtship, male juncos spread their tails, revealing their tail white, and a previous experiment has shown that males with experimentally enhanced tail white are more attractive to females. To determine whether females with experimentally enhanced tail white would be preferred by males, we clipped and replaced tail feathers of females, creating a control group with low to natural levels of tail white and an enhanced group with high levels. We tested preference in a mate choice apparatus like that used previously and found that males courted both control and enhanced females and displayed individual preferences but showed no collective preference for members of either category of females. Because we found neither a preference for trait values that indicate greater age/experience (experimentally enhanced females) nor a preference for less male-like appearance (control females), our results are inconsistent with a role for male mate choice in the maintenance of tail white in females. Female tail white may be subject to selection in another context or persist owing to a genetic correlation between the sexes. Regardless, the sexes apparently prefer different trait values, which suggests that preferences are expressed independently in males and females.

Uniformity of structural colour is suggested to signal developmental stability during feather growth, the colour constituting an amplifier. For structural coloration produced by coloured portions of barbules which are susceptible to loss by abrasion, the intensity of colour is suggested to signal feather quality and abrasion-resistance, the structural colour constituting an amplifying handicap. In both cases, large areas of structural coloured plumage may be more revealing of quality than small areas. Predictions as to the extent, position and combinations of these structural colours relative to carotenoid and melanin coloration were derived from these mechanisms and supported by comparative tests. Structural coloration may thus be a component in multiple messages of individual quality in plumage coloration.},

	abstract = {The inherited bacterium Wolbachia spreads through the manipulation of host reproduction, and has been suggested to be an important factor in arthropod evolution: from host speciation to the evolution of sex-determination systems. Past work has shown that members of this group may produce cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminize genetically male hosts, and induce host parthenogenesis. Here, we report an expansion of the range of reproductive manipulations produced by members of this clade, recording Wolbachia strains that kill male hosts during embryogenesis in two host species, the ladybird Adalia bipunctata, and the butterfly Acraea encedon. Both male-killing bacteria belong to the B group of Wolbachia. However, phylogenetic analyses were unable to resolve whether the bacteria in the two species are monophyletic, or represent independent origins of male-killing among the B-group Wolbachia. We also found significant divergence within the wsp gene of Wolbachia strains found in different A. bipunctata individuals, suggesting this host species contains two Wolbachia strains, diverged in wsp sequence but monophyletic. Our observations reinforce the notion that Wobbachia may be an important agent driving arthropod evolution, and corroborates previous suggestions that male-killing behaviour is easily evolved by invertebrate symbionts.},

Expression of such traits is sensitive to environmental factors, so they can function as bioindicators of environmental contamination. Of particular value may be carotenoid-based coloration because it is commonly used as a social signal and these pigments have important health functions. 2. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) in captivity were exposed to dietary {PCBs} in March. Colour and plasma carotenoids of exposed and control birds were evaluated at pairing and courtship in April, and in winter in December. Juveniles produced by these birds (exposed to {PCBs} only in ovo) were examined at fledging and in winter. 3. The brightly coloured ceres and lores were evaluated by comparison to colour charts and quantified using digital photographs, and plasma carotenoid concentrations were quantified by spectrophotometry. 4. During breeding, {PCB}-exposed kestrels differed from controls for both colour and carotenoids, although the nature of effects was sex-specific. Carotenoids of juveniles were not related to treatment at fledging. 5. In winter, {PCB}-exposure resulted in patterns of colour/carotenoid variation opposite to controls; exposed adult males were duller, and juveniles of both sexes were brighter, than controls. {PCB} juveniles had higher plasma levels of carotenoids. Sexual dimorphism was apparent in colour and carotenoids of control adults, but not for {PCB}-exposed birds. 6. Our results are consistent with endocrine disruption. Modulation of both colour and carotenoids may have serious consequences to social behaviour and health.},

Few studies, however, explicitly relate the intra-scale microstructures to overall butterfly visibility both in terms of reflected and transmitted intensities and viewing angles. Using a focused-laser technique, we investigated the absolute reflectivity and transmissivity associated with the single-scale microstructures of two species of Morpho butterfly and the mechanisms behind their remarkable: wide-angle visibility Measurements indicate that certain Morpho microstructures reflect up to 75\% of the incident blue light over an angle range of greater than 100 degrees in one plane and 15 degrees in the other. We show that incorporation of a second layer of more transparent scales, above a layer of highly iridescent scales, leads to very strong diffraction, and we suggest this effect acts to increase further the angle range over which incident light is reflected. Measurements using index-matching techniques yield the complex refractive index of the cuticle material comprising the single-scale microstructure to be n = (1.56 +/- 0.01) + (0.06 +/- 0.01)i. This figure is required for theoretical modelling of such microstructure systems.},

For example, chromatic information has been shown to enhance or suppress depth from luminance depending on whether chromatic edges are aligned or orthogonal with luminance edges. Here we explored more generally how chromatic information interacts with luminance information that specifies shape from shading. Using a depth-matching task, we measured perceived depth in sinusoidal and square-wave gratings (specifying close-to sinusoidal and triangle-wave depth profiles, respectively) in three conditions. In the first, as we varied luminance contrast in the presence of an orthogonal chromatic grating, perceived depth increased (consistent with classical shape from shading). When we held the luminance at a fixed contrast and varied the chromatic grating in the other two conditions (orthogonal or aligned), we found large and inconsistent individual differences. Some participants exhibited the expected pattern of enhancement and suppression, but most did not, either for the sinusoidal or square-wave stimuli. Our results cast doubt on the idea that the interaction demonstrates a single high-level heuristic linked to depth perception. Instead, we speculate that interactions are more likely due to early cross-channel masking.},

The long-term selection populations used here were originally established 30 years ago from a single cage population (originating from a maternal one) and subsequently subjected to divergent selection for tolerance of toxins in food (heavy metals versus ethanol) to investigate this question. Those populations now differ in sexual isolation and Wolbachia infection status. Wolbachia are common and widespread bacteria infecting arthropods and nematodes. Attention has recently focused on their potential role in insect speciation, due to post-mating sperm-egg incompatibilities induced by the bacteria. In this paper we examine the potential effect of Wolbachia on the level of sexual isolation. By antibiotic curing, we show that removal of Wolbachia decreases levels of mate discrimination (sexual isolation index) between populations by about 50\%. Backcrossing experiments confirm that this effect is due to infection status rather than to genetic changes in the populations resulting from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment has no effect on mate discrimination level between uninfected populations. Our findings suggest that the presence of Wolbachia (or another undetected bacterial associate) act as an additive factor contributing to the level of pre-mating isolation between these Drosophila melanogaster populations. Given the ubiquity of bacterial associates of insects, such effects could be relevant to some speciation events.},

	abstract = {Studies of brilliant carotenoid-based coloration in birds have traditionally centred on the role that these colours play in attracting mates. More recently, biologists have begun to take a biochemical approach to understanding the types of pigments found in feathers and how these relate to the expression of ornamental coloration. Nevertheless, surprisingly few studies have assessed the types and amounts of carotenoids present in the diet or blood of animals in relation to season, sex, condition or sexually attractive colour traits, particularly for wild birds. It is conceivable not only that the total concentration of pigments available is an important predictor of sexual attractiveness and mate quality, but also that specific pigments vary among individuals and play more important physiological and pigmenting roles than others. We investigated the carotenoid content of blood and feathers in wild-caught, yellow-pigmented male American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis) throughout the year to determine the optimal biochemical strategy for becoming colourful. We found that birds acquired two main yellow hydroxycarotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) from the diet during both moulting and non-moulting periods. Blood concentrations of both pigments changed significantly over time, with moulting birds accumulating higher levels of both lutein and zeaxanthin, but proportionally more zeaxanthin, than non-moulting birds. Moulting birds that acquired more lutein and more zeaxanthin in blood deposited a higher concentration of carotenoid pigments (canary xanthophylls A and B) into plumage and acquired more colourful feathers. In sum, these results indicate that (a) the types of dietary carotenoids available across seasons do not change in American goldfinches, (b) seasonal fluctuations in plasma-carotenoid signatures may result from differences in dietary access or pigment processing, and (c) the best biochemical strategy for becoming a colourful, wild male goldfinch is to accumulate as many dietary/blood pigments as possible during moult.

Bees did not discriminate between similar colours until the colour distance was well above discrimination threshold, but then discrimination fitted a sigmoidal-type function. The results for this absolute conditioning function and a previously determined function for differential conditioning were compared, and it is shown that the absolute conditioning function best explains the discrimination and flower constancy behaviour of bees that has previously been observed in natural settings. Modeling of the empirically determined absolute discrimination function allows for predictions of how bees would discriminate between flowers in complex foraging conditions that might include changes in the background and/or illumination colour. The absolute conditioning function should thus serve as an important guide for the evaluation of pollinator discriminations between flowers in natural settings, and for the understanding of why there may have been considerable evolutionary pressure on plants to evolve distinctive flower colours so as to promote flower constancy in important pollinators.},

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration.},

We quantified the colour properties of male plumage, the background and the ambient light at the hybrid zone, and allopatric golden and white populations. As measured by the perceived difference in colour between plumage and background, we found that yellow plumage appears more conspicuous than white plumage in the hybrid zone and allopatric golden-collar habitats, whereas white plumage appears more conspicuous than yellow plumage in the allopatric white-collared habitat.

During mate search males of the spider, Stegodyphus lineatus experience high mortality and low female encounter rate. Females vary in sexual maturity and mating status (virgin and mated) and hence in reproductive value for males, which should influence male mating effort. Due to high costs of remating, only virgin females are expected to signal mate attraction. Males would benefit from mating preferentially with virgins due to the costs of overcoming mated females' resistance, although they gain paternity share. Males should avoid immature females, unless guarding precopulatory to access females on maturation. Low encounter rates predict males to invest also in females of inferior reproductive value. We investigated male ability to discriminate immature, virgin, and mated females by assessing: the number of females males visit in the field; male mating effort and male discrimination of females based on silk cues in laboratory trials. In the field, males were found most frequently with virgin females. Male mating effort, copulation success, and preference based on silk cues were higher with mature compared with immature females. Our data suggest that females signal sexual receptivity and that males are able to discriminate both sexual maturity and mating status, however, males do not exert strong preference for virgins. The combination of high costs of mate search and low encounter rate likely exerts selection on males to mate indiscriminately and overcome female resistance to remating.},

	abstract = {Many plant species reward their pollinators, whereas some species, particularly among orchids, do not. Similarity of floral cues between co-flowering species influences how rapidly pollinators learn to avoid deceptive plants. This learning process, which affects the reproductive success of deceptive plants, may additionally depend on relative timing of flowering of sympatric rewarding and deceptive species. We tested the combined effects of corolla colour similarity and flowering order of rewarding and deceptive artificial inflorescences on visitation by naive bumblebees. When deceptive inflorescences were offered after rewarding inflorescences, bumblebees visited them four times more often if both species were similar compared with when they were dissimilar. Pollinator visitation rate to deceptive inflorescences offered before rewarding inflorescences was intermediate and independent of similarity. Thus, early-flowering deceptive species avoid the costs of dissimilarity with rewarding species. This mechanism may favour adaptive evolution of flowering phenology in deceptive species and explain why temperate deceptive orchids usually flower earlier than rewarding ones.},

	abstract = {Of the many traits seen in cryptic prey animals, countershading (darker pigmentation on those surfaces exposed to the most lighting) is one of the commonest, and paradoxically one of the least understood. Countershading has been hypothesized to enhance crypsis by shadow-obliteration, in which lighter coloration on the undersides compensates for increased shadow in these regions, thus reducing detection by visually hunting predators. We tested the hypothesis that countershading enhances crypsis in two experiments with artificial prey presented to free-living birds. In the first experiment, artificial prey were presented on lawns to a range of bird species. In the second experiment, the prey were presented on green boards to individual blackbirds, Turdus merula. In both experiments countershaded prey had significantly lower levels of predation than controls. Our results show that countershading can enhance cryptic protection and has important implications for the evolutionary ecology of prey defences.

	abstract = {Despite the functional significance of melanin-based plumage coloration in social and sexual signaling, the mechanisms controlling its information content are poorly understood. The T-regulation hypothesis proposes that melanin ornaments signal competitive abilities via the effects of testosterone (T) mediating both melanization and sexual/aggressive behaviors. Using the phylogenetic comparative approach, we tested whether frontal black melanization is associated with elevated T around the time of breeding plumage development across all bird species with available T-data. We found a context-dependent relationship between melanization and T, varying with the type of ornamentation (patchy or full-black) and with the presumed taxonomic distribution of the hormonal control of plumage dichromatism. Within two taxa in which male plumage development is assumed androgen-dependent (Charadriiformes, Corvida), evolutionary increases in male melanization, and melanin dichromatism correlated with increases in T in most analyses but not within the basal lineage (ratites, Galloanseriformes) with androgen-independent male plumage. Among Passeroidea with presumably genetically or luteinizing-hormone-based male plumage, melanization and its dichromatism correlated with T only in species with {\textless} 100\% frontal melanization. These results were robust as we controlled for several confounding variables such as mating and parental behaviors. This study is the first to test and support the T-regulation hypothesis interspecifically, suggesting that among-species differences in melanization may have evolved in response to differences in circulating T in certain avian taxa. Our results imply that the extent of black ornamentation may serve as an honest indicator of male competitiveness in those species that evolved an appropriate hormonal basis (T dependence) for color production.},

We investigated one such complex colour phenotype: the highly chromatic wing colours of pierid butterflies including oranges, yellows and patterns which appear white to the human eye, but strongly absorb the ultraviolet ({UV}) wavelengths visible to butterflies. Pierids produce these bright colours using wing scales that contain collections of minute granules. However, to date, no work has directly characterized the molecular composition or optical properties of these granules. We present results that indicate these granules contain pterin pigments. We also find that pterin granules increase light reflection from single wing scales, such that wing scales containing denser granule arrays reflect more light than those with less dense granule collections. As male wing scales contain more pterin granules than those of females, the sexual dichromatism found in many pierid species can be explained by differences in wing scale pterin deposition. Additionally, the colour pattern elements produced by these pterins are known to be important during mating interactions in a number of pierid species. Therefore, we discuss the potential relevance of our results within the framework of sexual selection and colour signal evolution.},

For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by‐product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.},

A general Prediction from theoretical models is that site fidelity should increase as a function of male age. In this study, I investigated the relationship between age and site fidelity in the territorial nymphalid butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.). A total of 144 males from a population in tropical Australia were captured and marked over two seasonal rounds in 1998. Sampling of the subsequent fidelity of these marked individuals provided two related lines of evidence in support of the age-based prediction. First, older males were more likely to be resighted at their territories on at least one occasion following their capture and marking. Second, the subsequent site fidelity of the group of males that was resighted at least once was related to age, with older males showing greater average fidelity. Both results were consistent across seasons. Taken in concert, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that fidelity is linked to age in this territorial butterfly. At this stage it is not possible to distinguish between increased competitive ability and increased motivation for fidelity as the underlying cause of this relationship.},

Feathers provide a unique system to analyze the development of complex morphological novelties. Here, we describe the interactions between Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) signaling during feather barb ridge morphogenesis. We demonstrate that activator-inhibitor models of Shh and Bmp2 signaling in the tubular feather epithelium are sufficient to explain the initial formation of a meristic pattern of barb ridges and the observed variation in barb morphogenesis in chick natal down feathers. Empirical tests support the assumptions of the model that, within the feather ectoderm, Shh (activator) up-regulates its own transcription and that of Bmp2 (inhibitor), whereas Bmp2 signaling down-regulates Shh expression. More complex models incorporating a second activator and dorsal/ventral polarized modification of activator signaling can produce all of the barb morphogenesis patterns observed during the growth of more complex branched pennaceous feathers: new barb ridge formation, helical growth, and barb ridge fusion. An integrated model of feather morphogenesis and evolution suggests that plumulaceous feather structure evolved by the establishment of activator-inhibitor interactions between Shh and Bmp2 signaling in the basal epithelium of the feather germ. Subsequently, pennaceous feather structure evolved through the integration of barb ridge morphogenesis with a second, local inhibitor and a dorsal/ventral signal gradient within the feather. The model is congruent with paleontological evidence that plumulaceous feathers are primitive to pennaceous feathers.},

However, the color signals of these spiders are also considered to be similar to those of the vegetation background, and thus the colorations function to camouflage the spiders. In this study, we evaluated these 2 hypotheses by field experiments and by quantifying the spiders' visibility to insects. We first compared the insect interception rates of orbs constructed by the orchid spider, Leucauge magnifica, with and without the spider. Orbs with spiders intercepted significantly more insects than orbs without. Such a result supported the prey attraction but not the camouflaging hypothesis. We then tested whether bright body colorations were responsible for L. magnifica's attractiveness to insects by manipulating the spiders' color signals with paint. Alteration of color signals significantly reduced L. magnifica's insect interception and consumption rates, indicating that these spiders' bright body parts were attractive to insects. Congruent with the finding of field manipulations were the color contrasts of various body parts of these spiders. When viewed against the vegetation background, the green body parts were lower, but the bright parts were significantly higher than the discrimination threshold. Results of this study thus provide direct evidence that bright body colorations of orb weavers function as visual lures to attract insects.},

The nature of the countergradient pattern is that geographical variation in the carotenoid content of the orange spots of males is counterbalanced by genetic variation in drosopterin production, resulting in a relatively uniform pigment ratio. A female hue preference could produce this pattern, because hue is the axis of colour variation most directly affected by the pigment ratio. To test this hypothesis, we crossed two populations differing in drosopterin production and produced an F2 generation with variable drosopterin levels. When the carotenoid content of the orange spots was held constant, female guppies preferred males with intermediate drosopterin levels. This shows that females do not simply prefer males with greater orange spot pigment content; instead, the ratio of the pigments also affects male attractiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for a hypothesized agent of countergradient sexual selection.},

The iridescence is virtually always in the ultraviolet wavelength range, but some species have a blue-peaking iridescence.

We conducted manipulative field experiments on two color ornaments of king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), the size of auricular patches of orange feathers and degree of {UV} reflectance from beak spots, to determine how the degree of ornamentation influenced pairing rate. In a reduction of auricular patch size, females paired significantly more quickly than males in both control and experimental samples. When this bias was taken into account statistically, pairing of individuals with reduced auricular patches was significantly delayed. We also reduced, but did not eliminate, {UV} reflectance from beak spots by applying a {UV} filter; no sex difference in pairing rate was evident in this experiment. Treated birds paired significantly more slowly than untreated control individuals, taking more than a week longer to pair on average than their unmanipulated counterparts, a result that was significant for males and approached significance for females. Our results may indicate mutual mate choice via {UV} reflectance of the beak spot. Given that this is a species where breeding is extremely slow and considerable investment by both males and females is required for successful reproduction, our results support the hypothesis that in such species, sexual selection might act on the same ornament in both sexes.},

In nestling birds, the carotenoids used for feather pigmentation may derive via three pathways: (1) via maternal transfer to egg yolk; (2) via paternal feeds early after hatching when females are mainly brooding; or (3) via feeds from both parents later in nestling life. We analysed the relative importance of the proposed carotenoid sources in a field experiment on great tit nestlings (Parus major). In a within-brood design we supplemented nestlings with carotenoids shortly after hatching, later on in the nestling life, or with a placebo. We show that the carotenoid-based colour expression of nestlings is modified maximally during the first 6 days after hatching. It reveals that the observed variation in carotenoid-based coloration is based only on mechanisms acting during a short period of time in early nestling life. The experiment further suggests that paternally derived carotenoids are the most important determinants of nestling plumage colour.},

However, while evidence for such countervailing selection exists for vertebrate color ornaments (e. g., Trinidadian guppies), similar studies have yet to be reported in invertebrates. Indeed, evidence for female mate choice based on extant variation in male coloration is limited in invertebrates, and researchers have not explicitly asked whether more attractive males are also more conspicuous to predators. Here we provide evidence that more chromatic male cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) are more attractive to females but should also be more conspicuous to predators. Female P. rapae preferentially mate with more chromatic males when choosing from populations of males with naturally occurring or commensurate, experimentally induced color variation. Mathematical models of female color vision confirm that females should be able to discriminate color differences between prospective mates. Further, chromatic and luminance contrast scores from female visual system models better predicted male mating success than did measures of male color derived more directly from color spectra. Last, models of avian color vision suggest that preferred males should be more conspicuous to known avian predators.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are a group of cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that cause reproduction alterations in arthropods, including parthenogenesis, reproductive incompatibility and feminization of genetic males. Two major subdivisions of Wolbachia (A and B) occur. Wolbachia are found in a number of well-studied insects, but their overall distribution in arthropods has not been well studied. A survey for Wolbachia in 157 Panamanian neotropical arthropod species was done using a polymerase chain reaction assay. Wolbachia were detected in 26 of 154 insect species (16.9\%) and zero of three arachnids (0\%). Extrapolating to the estimated total number of insect species present globally (10-30 million), an estimated 1.69-5.07 million insect species are infected with these bacteria, making Wolbachia an extremely abundant bacterial group. Wolbachia were found in each of the major insect orders examined, including Coleoptera (6/57 infected), Diptera (5/14), Hemiptera/Homoptera (1/7), Hymenoptera (6/23) Lepidoptera (7/43) and Orthoptera (1/8). Of the 26 positives, eight species were found to be singly infected with A group Wolbachia, nine singly with B group Wolbachia and nine doubly infected with both A and B group Wolbachia. Double infections occur at significantly higher frequencies than expected by chance. The abundance of Wolbachia further supports their potential importance as a mechanism for rapid speciation in insects.},

Population transformation using the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is particularly attractive because this maternally-inherited agent provides a powerful mechanism to invade natural populations through cytoplasmic incompatibility(2). When Wolbachia are introduced into mosquitoes, they interfere with pathogen transmission and influence key life history traits such as lifespan(3-6). Here we describe how the {wMel} Wolbachia infection, introduced into the dengue vector Aedes aegypti from Drosophila melanogaster(7), successfully invaded two natural A. aegypti populations in Australia, reaching near-fixation in a few months following releases of {wMel}-infected A. aegypti adults. Models with plausible parameter values indicate that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes suffered relatively small fitness costs, leading to an unstable equilibrium frequency {\textless}30\% that must be exceeded for invasion. These findings demonstrate that Wolbachia-based strategies can be deployed as a practical approach to dengue suppression with potential for area-wide implementation.},

Males that moulted at southerly latitudes were more likely to grow yellowish feathers compared with males that moulted more orange - red feathers further north. Independent samples obtained on both the breeding and the wintering grounds showed that red chroma - an index of carotenoid content - was not related to the mean daily feather growth rate, suggesting that condition during moult did not influence feather colour. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that feather colour is influenced by ecological conditions at the locations where the birds moulted. We suggest that these colour signals may be influenced by geographical variation in diet related to the availability of carotenoids.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) colorations have garnered extensive theoretical and empirical treatment in recent years, although the majority of studies have concerned themselves with avian taxa. However, many lizards have acute visual systems with retinal photoreceptors that are sensitive to {UV} wavelengths, and also display {UV}-reflecting colour patches. In the present study, we used {UV} photography and full-spectrum reflectance spectrophotometry to describe intra- and intersexual colour variation in adult ocellated lizards Lacerta (Timon) lepida and to obtain evidence of {UV}-based ornamentation. We also investigated whether any colour traits correlate with morphological traits potentially related to individual quality. The results obtained show that the prominent eyespots and blue outer ventral scales ({OVS}) that ocellated lizards have on their flanks reflect strongly in the {UV} range and are best described as {UV}/blue in coloration. The eyespots of males are larger and cover a larger surface area than those of females. However, these differences can be entirely accounted for by sex differences in body size, with males being generally larger than females. We also found differences in the shape of reflectance curves from males and females, with the eyespots and blue {OVS} of males being more {UV}-shifted than those of females. Other body regions have extremely low {UV} reflectance and are not sexually dichromatic. Eyespot size and the total surface area covered by eyespots increases with body size in males but not in females, suggesting that they may be signalling an intrinsic individual characteristic such as body size or male fighting ability. We also discuss the alternative and non-exclusive hypothesis that eyespots may function in lizards of both sexes as protective markings against predators.

Here we show that the iridescent scales of the Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly give a different optical response to different individual vapours, and that this optical response dramatically outperforms that of existing nano-engineered photonic sensors. The reflectance spectra of the scales provide information about the nature and concentration of the vapours, allowing us to identify a range of closely related vapours-water, methanol, ethanol and isomers of dichloroethylene when they are analysed individually. By comparing the reflectance as a function of time for different vapours, we deduce that wing regions with scale structures of differing spatial periodicity give contributions to the overall spectral response at different wavelengths. Our optical model explains the effect of different components of the wing scales on the vapour response, and could steer the design of new man-made optical gas sensors.},

Our analyses imply subdivision of sampled populations groupings based mostly on different dorsal colorations. Our results also reveal that populations with very similar patterns may differ markedly in colour and vice versa. It is striking that these aposematic toads show a pronounced variation in colour and patterning among and within populations showing individuals with a conspicuous bright dorsal colouration but also morphs with a rather cryptic black or drab colouration.

Many of these displays are widely publicized as resulting from chemical colorants known as pigments, which act by selectively “absorbing” part of the light spectrum (Appendix 1). However, the full diversity of animal coloration is just as strongly influenced by optically active surface structures, which act by selectively “reflecting” light (i.e., scattering). In cases where light is scattered coherently, these structural colors produce displays that are often metallic, iridescent, or kaleidoscopic in appearance. In addition to structural coloration, mechanisms such as bioluminescence and fluorescence allow the actual creation of colored light, thereby transcending the simple reflectance of whatever ambient wavelengths are available. There is enormous variation among all of these classes of colorants, and most signals arise through the interaction of diverse suites of pigments and reflecting (structural) mechanisms. Despite this complexity, however, the field of behavioral ecology has been largely preoccupied with understanding how carotenoids—a single group of pigments—may broker the honest signaling of individual quality. This focus has proven highly productive in many respects, but it has also fostered a limited and overly simplistic view of how color signals really work. As we outline here, the complete emerging story of animal coloration is far more complex and interesting.},

Here, we report on a screening of seven leafcutter ant species of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex.

For Acromyrmex echinatior and A. octospinosus, a screening across all castes shows that gynes (prospective queens) have higher infection rates than workers and males. The low infection rate of workers suggests that workers lose their infection during development. This we interpret as adaptive, because a heritable symbiont does not benefit from being present in sterile workers. Both {CI} and {MK} could potentially account for the low infection rate of males. Formal theoretical models show greater support for the {MK} scenario in the free living species A. echinatior and A. octospinosus but indicate that Wolbachia in the social parasite A. insinuator may cause {CI}, supporting a scenario of sympatric speciation of the social parasite.

The bright body coloration of certain orb-weaving spiders seems to serve as a visual lure to diurnal prey. However, no studies have examined whether this coloration affects spiders' nocturnal hunting. Some nocturnal lepidopteran pollinators use colour vision to locate their food resources, so orb-weaving spiders' bright coloration may also be attractive to visually oriented nocturnal insects. To assess the role of body coloration of the orchid spider, Leucauge magnifica, in luring nocturnal prey, we investigated whether: ( 1) these spiders actively hunt during the night; ( 2) nocturnal prey comprise a significant proportion of total prey intake; and ( 3) altering body colour signals significantly affect the nocturnal prey capture rate. Round-the- clock monitoring of L. magnifica activity patterns showed that they hunt more actively at night. Owing to the presence of relatively large moths in their diet at night, L. magnifica consumed higher prey biomass during nocturnal hunting, although this was not statistically significant owing to large variability. Painting over the spiders' yellow ventrum stripes significantly reduced their moth capture rate. These results show that certain orb-weaving spiders with bright body coloration attract nocturnal prey, and they obtain larger prey from nocturnal hunting.},

	abstract = {Several studies have suggested that peak plumage reflectance in birds matches color preferences used in mate choice. We tested this hypothesis in adult satin bowerbird males that have a short-wavelength saturated blue-black plumage with a peak reflectance in the {UV}. We found that the chroma of the blue (405-480 nm), but not the peak reflecting {UV} (320-400 nm) portion of the male plumage spectrum was significantly correlated with male mating success. A plot of correlation coefficients between male mating success and plumage saturation showed a well-defined peak in the blue. This suggests that: 1) blue plumage coloration is more important in mate choice than {UV} or other colors, and 2) that there is a mismatch between the peak reflectance of the plumage of male satin bowerbirds and the range of plumage wavelengths that are correlated with male mating success. This indicates that it is not safe to infer a role of {UV} or other colors in mate choice simply because of a peak in plumage reflectance.},

	abstract = {It is not well understood how primates combine olfactory and visual cues in their natural behaviour, especially during feeding. In this study we conducted field observations of a group of wild, frugivorous black-handed spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi (Platyrrhini), consisting of both dichromats (N = 11) and trichromats (N = 9) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. We focused on the fruit foraging behaviour, for which involvement of vision has been well studied. We examined how often the monkeys inspected fruits by sniffing them during their fruit feeding attempts (i.e. sniffing index). We found that both dichromats and trichromats sniffed the visually cryptic fruit species more often than the conspicuous species, with the sniffing index being negatively correlated with the luminance and blue-yellow contrasts of fruits to background leaves. Furthermore, the sniffing index was negatively correlated with the proportion of fruits eaten (versus rejected) following a foraging attempt in both dichromats and trichromats. These results suggest that monkeys use olfaction for discrimination between edible and inedible fruits when vision alone is insufficient to evaluate the quality of fruits, showing the first documentation of interplay between vision and olfaction in primate feeding behaviour under natural conditions.

Although much attention has been devoted to structural coloration reflecting in {UV}, the signaling function of structural colors lacking {UV} reflectance and those that exhibit iridescence coloration are poorly documented. The train of the peacock (Pavo cristatus), a classical example of a sexually selected trait, is composed of iridescent structurally colored eyespots not reflecting in {UV}. Until today, the role played by the structural color of the eyespots in female mate choice has never been investigated using spectrometry. We measured eyespot coloration from a stationary angle (static coloration) and the change in coloration resulting from different angles (iridescent coloration). We assessed coloration with reflectance spectrometry, and we analyzed reflectance spectra using 2 methods. First, we extracted the reflectance spectra shape descriptors hue, brightness, and chroma. Second, we computed color and brightness contrasts signaled by eyespot feathers, taking peafowl color visual sensitivity into account. Iridescence was estimated by the maximal change for all parameters. Brightness was correlated with male mating success. The maximal change in color contrast was correlated with both the frequency of male visitation by females and male mating success. These results suggest that peahens can use both static and dynamic (i.e., iridescent) aspects of plumage structural coloration as signals to detect and choose their mates.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia form a group of closely related intracellular Proteobacteria that manipulate reproduction of their arthropod host in various ways. They are widespread in insects, but have not been not looked for in other arthropods except a few isopods and a predatory mite. Recently, Wolbachia were demonstrated to he widespread in mites also. Here, I report that Wolbachia induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in two spider mite species, Tetranychus urticae and T. turkestani, in crosses between infected and uninfected individuals. Uninfected mitts were derived from the infected lineage by antibiotic treatment. Similar to other examples of cytoplasmic incompatibility, subsequent crosses between uninfected (cured) female and infected male spider mites were different from all other cross combinations. This suggests that the dynamics and evolution in Wolbachia-mite relationships may share many features with the Wolbachia-insect systems. Interestingly, the incompatible cross showed high F-1 zygotic mortality among females, but not among males. This zygotic mortality in the haplodiploid spider mites was in sharp contrast to the phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic incompatibility reported previously in haplodiploid insects. In the latter, cytoplasmic incompatibility results in all male or male-biased offspring because of haploidization of the fertilized egg with little or no zygotic mortality. Possible explanations are low bacterial densities and the different, holokinetic chromosome structure in spider mites.},

However, this hypothesis has seldom been evaluated, particularly for mammals. Here, we test Glogers rule using a dataset consisting of more than 100 primate species representing all major primate clades. Location Africa, Madagascar, Asia and the Neotropics. Methods We used museum skins, digital photography, and colour correction software to quantify the brightness of the dorsal and ventral pelage surface of each species. We utilized the mean actual evapotranspiration ({AET}) within the geographic range of each species as a proxy for habitat conditions and accounted for additional variables that may influence coloration. To analyse the data, we used a generalized linear model that simultaneously accounts for the effects of phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation. Results We found that increasing levels of {AET} were significantly related to increasing pelage darkness on the dorsal surface of species, while accounting for other effects. Main conclusions Our finding provides further support for the applicability of Gloger's rule to mammals, and is the first broad-scale evaluation for primates. The mechanism driving Gloger's rule is not easy to discern, but may include increased background matching for species living in relatively light or dark habitats, increased resistance to keratin-degrading micro-organisms in hair with large amounts of eumelanin, and/or thermoregulation.},

This study investigates preferences of foraging poultry chicks (Gallus gallus) as they peck at coloured objects. Work on colour recognition often deals with responses to monochromatic lights and how animals divide the spectrum. We used complementary colours, where the intermediate is grey, and related the chicks' choices to three models of the factors that may affect the attractiveness. Two models assume that attractiveness is determined by a metric based on the colour discrimination threshold either (i) by chromatic contrast against the background or (ii) relative to an internal standard. An alternative third model is that categorization is important. We tested newly hatched and 9-day-old chicks with four pairs of ( avian) complementary colours, which were orange, blue, red and green for humans. Chromatic contrast was more relevant to newly hatched chicks than to 9-day-old birds, but in neither case could contrast alone account for preferences; especially for orange over blue. For older chicks, there is evidence for categorization of complementary colours, with a boundary at grey.},

We investigated the colour, anatomy, nanostructure and biophysics of structurally coloured skin from two species of primates - mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) and vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) - and two species of marsupials - mouse opossum (Marmosa mexicana) and wooly opossum (Caluromys derbianus). We used two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of transmission electron micrographs ({TEMs}) of the collagen arrays in the primate tissues to test whether these structural colours are produced by incoherent or coherent scattering (i.e. constructive interference). The structural colours in Mandrillus rump and facial skin and Cercopithecus scrotum are produced by coherent scattering by quasi-ordered arrays of parallel dermal collagen fibres. The 2-D Fourier power spectra of the collagen arrays from Mandrillus and Cercopithecus reveal ring-shaped distributions of Fourier power at intermediate spatial frequencies, demonstrating a substantial nanostructure of the appropriate spatial frequency to produce the observed blue hues by coherent scattering alone. The Fourier power spectra and the observed reflectance spectra falsify assumptions and predictions of the incoherent, Rayleigh scattering hypothesis. Samples of blue Marmosa and Caluromys scrotum conform generally to the anatomy seen in Mandrillus and Cercopithecus but were not sufficiently well preserved to conduct numerical analyses. Colour-producing collagen arrays in mammals have evolved multiple times independently within the two clades of mammals known to have trichromatic colour vision. Mammalian colour-producing collagen arrays are anatomically and mechanistically identical to structures that have evolved convergently in the dermis of many lineages of birds, the tapetum of some mammals and the cornea of some fishes. These collagen arrays constitute quasi-ordered 2-D photonic crystals.},

Here, we tested this hypothesis by using comparative and experimental approaches. First, we studied variation in egg coloration of 98 species of European passerines measured using {UV}-visible reflectance spectrometry (300-700 nm) in relation to nesting habits. Analyses based on raw data and controlling for phylogenetic distances both at the species and the family levels revealed that hole-nester species produced eggs with higher {UV} reflectance than those nesting in open habitats. The experimental approach consisted of the manipulation of {UV} reflectance of the experimental eggs introduced outside the nest-cup of the hole-nester spotless starling Sturnus unicolor and the study of the retrieval of these eggs. Ultraviolet-reflecting eggs (controls) were more frequently retrieved to the nest-cup than nonreflecting (-{UV}) eggs. These results were not due to '-{UV}' eggs being recognized by starlings as parasitic because when a parasitic egg is detected, starlings removed it from the nest-box. Therefore, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that {UV} egg colours are designed to provide highly detectable targets for parent birds in dark nest environments.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ultimate causes for the presence of polymorphisms within populations requires knowledge of how the expression of discrete morphs is regulated. In the present study, we explored the determination mechanism of a colour dimorphism in larvae of the butterfly Pararge xiphia (Satyrinae: Nymphalidae) with the ultimate aim of understanding its potential adaptive value. Last-instar larvae of P. xiphia develop into either a green or a brown morph, although all individuals are invariably green during the preceding three instars. A series of laboratory experiments reveal that morph development is strongly environmentally dependent and not the result of alternative alleles at one locus. Photoperiod, temperature, and in particular larval density, all influenced morph determination. The strong effect of a high larval density in inducing the brown morph parallels other known cases of density-dependent melanization in Lepidopteran larvae. Because melanization is often correlated with increased immune function, this type of determination mechanism is expected to be adaptive. However, the ecology and behaviour of P. xiphia larvae suggests that increased camouflage under high-density conditions may be an additional adaptive explanation. We conclude that the colour dimorphism of P. xiphia larvae is determined by a developmental threshold that is influenced both by heredity and by environmental conditions, and that selection for increased immune function and camouflage under high-density conditions may be responsible for maintaining the dimorphism.

	abstract = {Ornamental bill color is postulated to function as a condition-dependent signal of individual quality in a variety of taxonomically distant bird families. Most red, orange, and yellow bill colors are derived from carotenoid pigments, and carotenoid deposition in ornamentation may trade off with their use as immunostimulants and antioxidants or with other physiological functions. Several studies have found that bill color changes in response to physiological perturbations, but how quickly such changes can occur remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that carotenoid-based orange bill color of American goldfinches Spinus tristis responds dynamically to rapid changes in physiological stress and reflects short-term changes in condition. We captured male and female goldfinches and measured bill color in the field and again under captive conditions several hours later. The following day, the captive birds were injected with either immunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) or a control saline and changes in bill color were measured over a five day period. Yellow saturation of the bill decreased within 6.5 h between the field and captivity measures on the first day, presumably in response to capture stress. Over the longer experimental period, bill hue and luminance decreased significantly, whereas saturation significantly increased in both {LPS} and control groups. Bill hue and luminance decreased significantly more in birds treated with {LPS} than in control birds. Among {LPS} treated birds, individuals expressing high bill color at the beginning of the experiment lost more color than low-color birds, but still retained higher color at the end of the experiment, suggesting that birds that invest heavily in bill coloration are able to sustain high costs in the face of a challenge. Bill color change may have resulted from rapid reallocation of carotenoids from ornamentation to immune function. However, the complex shifts in bill color over time suggest that bill color may be influenced by multiple carotenoid compounds and/or changes in blood flow or chemistry in vessels just beneath the translucent keratinized outer layer of the bill. We conclude that bill color is a dynamic, condition-dependent trait that strategically and reliably signals short-term fluctuations in physiological condition.},

Multiple independent signals from separate photonic structures within the same sub-micrometre device are currently unknown in animals. However, they would serve to increase the complexity and specificity of the optical signature, enhancing the information conveyed. This could be important during intrasexual encounters, in which iridescent male wing colours are employed as threat displays. Blazed diffraction gratings, like those found in L. nitida, are asymmetric photonic structures and drive most of the incident light into one diffraction order. Similar gratings are used in spectrometers, limiting the spectral range over which the spectrometer functions.

	abstract = {We conducted two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier analyses of the spatial variation in refractive index of the spongy medullary keratin from four different colours of structurally coloured feather barbs from three species of bird: the rose-faced lovebird, Agapornis roseicollis (Psittacidae), the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus (Psittacidae), and the Gouldian finch, Poephila guttata (Estrildidae). These results indicate that the spongy medullary keratin is a nanostructured tissue that functions as an array of coherent scatterers. The nanostructure of the medullary keratin is nearly uniform in all directions. The largest Fourier components of spatial variation in refractive index in the tissue are of the appropriate size to produce the observed colours by constructive interference alone. The peaks of the predicted reflectance spectra calculated from the 2D Fourier power spectra are congruent with the reflectance spectra measured by using microspectrophotometry. The alternative physical models for the production of these colours, the Rayleigh and Mie theories, hypothesize that medullary keratin is an incoherent array and that scattered waves are independent in phase. This assumption is falsified by the ring-like Fourier power spectra of these feathers, and the spacing of the scattering air vacuoles in the medullary keratin. Structural colours of avian feather barbs are produced by constructive interference of coherently scattered light waves from the optically heterogeneous matrix of keratin and air in the spongy medullary layer.},

	abstract = {Males of many species can breed in distinct alternative phenotypes; for example, in many birds some males breed in dull plumage while others breed in bright plumage. Because females often appear to prefer brighter males, it is unclear why some males breed in dull plumage. Males in dull plumage might enjoy enhanced within-pair reproductive success if they can gain access to better breeding territories, or they might have relatively high extrapair reproductive success if they are better able to intrude on the territories of other males. To test these possibilities, we examined the reproductive consequences of plumage color in the red-backed fairy-wren (Malurus melanocephalus), a species in which males can breed in either bright plumage or dull plumage or serve as nonbreeding auxiliaries. Male plumage color was distributed bimodally and was loosely associated with age, such that some males molted into bright plumage a year or more earlier than others. Both male phenotypes were cuckolded at similar rates, but bright males sired significantly more extrapair young than did dull males, and this effect was independent of age. Thus, 1-year-old males who bred in dull plumage had low seasonal reproductive success compared with same-aged males who bred in bright plumage. These results suggest that males may not reap any fitness benefits by breeding in dull coloration, compared with breeding in bright plumage, but rather may be constrained to breed in suboptimal plumage by the timing of plumage acquisition.},

	abstract = {Stellar nucleosynthesis of heavy elements such as carbon allowed the formation of organic molecules in space, which appear to be widespread in our Galaxy. The physical and chemical conditions-including density, temperature, ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation and energetic particles-determine reaction pathways and the complexity of organic molecules in different space environments. Dense interstellar clouds are the birth sites of stars of all masses and their planetary systems. During the protostellar collapse, interstellar organic molecules in gaseous and solid phases-are integrated into protostellar disks from which planets and smaller solar system bodies form. After the formation of the planets 4.6 billion years ago, our solar system, including the Earth, was subjected to frequent impacts for several hundred million years. Life on Earth may have emerged during or shortly after this heavy bombardment phase, perhaps as early as 3.90-3.85 billion years ago, but the exact timing remains uncertain. A prebiotic reducing atmosphere, if present, predicts that building blocks of biopolymers-such as amino acids, sugars, purines and pyrimidines-would be formed in abundance. Recent modelling of the Earth's early atmosphere suggests, in contrast, more neutral conditions (e.g. H2O, N-2, {CO}2), thus, precluding the formation of significant concentrations of prebiotic organic compounds. Moreover, even if the Earth's atmosphere were reducing, the presence of {UV} photons would readily destroy organic compounds unless they were quickly sequestered away in rocks or in the prebiotic ocean. Other possible sources of organic compounds would be high temperature vent chemistry, although the stability of such compounds (bases, amino acids) in these environments remains problematic. Finally, organic compounds may have been delivered to the Earth by asteroids, comets and smaller fragments, such as meteorites and interplanetary dust particles. It is likely that a combination of these sources contributed to the building blocks of life on the early Earth. It may even have taken several starts before life surpassed the less than ideal conditions at the surface. What is certain is that once life emerged, it learned to adapt quickly taking advantage of every available refuge and energy source (e.g. photosynthesis and chemosynthesis), an attribute that eventually led to complex metabolic life and even. our own existence. Current experimental research investigating the origin of life is focused on the spontaneous formation of stable polymers out of monomers. However, understanding the spontaneous formation of structure is not enough to understand the formation of life. The introduction and evolution of information and complexity is essential to our definition of life. The formation of complexity and the means to distribute and store information are currently being investigated in a number of theoretical frameworks, such as evolving algorithms, chaos theory and modem evolution theory. In this paper we review the physical and chemical processes that form and process organic matter in space. In particular we discuss the chemical pathways of organic matter in the interstellar medium, its evolution in protoplanetary disks and its integration into solar system material. Furthermore, we investigate the role of impacts and the delivery of organic matter to the prebiotic Earth. Processes that may have assembled prebiotic molecules to produce the first genetic material and ideas about the formation of complexity in chemical networks are also discussed.},

Females of few crab-spider species encounter such situations when lying on flowers to ambush pollinators. To evaluate the efficiency of spider camouflage on flowers, we measured by spectroradiometry adult female Thomisus onustus and marguerite daisies, Leucanthemum vulgare. We compared chromatic contrast (color used for short-range detection) of each pair of spider and flower to detection thresholds computed in the visual systems of both Hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predator. We also computed achromatic contrast (brightness) used for long-range detection. In both visual systems, each individual spider was efficiently matching the precise color of the flower center on which it was hunting. Being significantly darker than flowers, crab-spiders could in theory be detected at long range by either predator or prey using achromatic contrast. However, long-range detection is unlikely, owing to small spider size. Spiders also generated significant chromatic and achromatic contrasts to both Hymenoptera and bird when moving on flower periphery. Our study is the first to identify which photoreceptors of both prey and predator are involved in camouflage. The analysis suggests more research on bird predation and vision to determine to which extent bird predators effectively constrain spider crypsis.},

	abstract = {Carotenoid-based plumage coloration of birds has been hypothesized to honestly reflect individual quality, either because carotenoids are difficult to acquire via food or because of a trade-off in allocation of carotenoids between maintenance and signaling functions. We tested whether differential foraging ability is a necessary precondition for maintaining individual differences in carotenoid-based plumage coloration in male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris). Wild-caught birds were brought into captivity, where half of them were supplemented with carotenoids while the other half was maintained on a carotenoid-poor diet. Color of the yellow parts of tail feathers, grown under natural conditions, was compared with that of the replacement feathers, grown in captivity. Carotenoid supplementation increased feather chroma (saturation). Color of wild-grown feathers significantly correlated with the color of lab-grown feathers. This result demonstrates the existence of a significant component of variation in carotenoid coloration, which reflects physiological qualities or genetic differences among individuals independent of foraging ability. Among both experimental groups, plasma carotenoid concentration during feather growth strongly correlated with chroma of the feathers grown in captivity. This indicates that carotenoid-based plumage coloration can reveal circulating carotenoid levels over a very wide range of concentrations, suggesting the ample signaling potential of such a mechanism.},

However, it has been studied almost exclusively in predator-prey systems, despite the fact that it may evolve in other groups, such as ectoparasites. The principle defense of hosts against ectoparasites is grooming behavior, which has a visual component. Host-imposed selection should lead to the evolution of background matching if it helps ectoparasites escape from grooming. Here we use sister taxa comparisons to show that avian feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) have evolved coloration that matches the host's plumage, except in the case of head lice, which are protected from grooming. We also show covariation of parasite and host color within a single species of louse. Thus, cryptic coloration has evolved both within and between species of feather lice. Other examples of the evolution of crypsis presumably exist among the 70,000 known species of ectoparasites that collectively represent five animal phyla.},

	abstract = {Wallace proposed in 1868 that natural rather than sexual selection could explain the striking differences in avian plumage dichromatism. Thus, he predicted that nesting habits, through their association with nest predation, could drive changes in sexual dichromatism by enabling females in cavity nesters to become as conspicuous as males, whereas Darwin (1871, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, John Murray, London) argued that sexual selection was the sole explanation for dichromatism. Sexual dichromatism is currently used as indicating the strength of sexual selection, and therefore testing Wallaces claim with modern phylogentically controlled methodologies is of prime interest for comparing the roles of natural and sexual selection in affecting the evolution of avian coloration. Here, we have related information on nest attendance, sexual dichromatism and nesting habits (open and cavity nesting) to male and female plumage conspicuousness in European passerines. Nest incubation attendance does not explain male or female plumage conspicuousness but nest type does. Moreover, although females of monochromatic and cavity nesting species are more conspicuous than females of other species, males of monochromatic and open nesting species are those with more cryptic plumage. Finally, analyses of character evolution suggest that changes in nesting habits influence the probability of changes in both dichromatism and plumage conspicuousness of males but do not significantly affect those in females. These results strongly suggest a role of nesting habits in the evolution of plumage conspicuousness of males, and a role for sexual selection also in females, both factors affecting the evolution of sexual dichromatism. We discuss our findings in relation to the debate that Darwin and Wallace maintained more than one century ago on the importance of natural and sexual selection in driving the evolution of plumage conspicuousness and sexual dichromatism in birds, and conclude that our results partly support the evolutionary scenarios envisaged by both extraordinary scientists.},

The plumage coloration has not, however, been studied in relation to bird vision, which extends to the {CV}-A waveband (320-400 nm). Using molecular sex determination and {UV}/{VIS} spectrometry, we report here that blue tits are sexually dichromatic in {UV}/blue spectral purity (chroma) of the brilliant crown patch. It is displayed in courtship by horizontal Posturing and erected nape feathers. A previously undescribed sexual dimorphism in crown size (controlling for body size) further supports its role as an epigamic ornament. Against 'grey-brown' leaf litter and bark during pair formation in early spring, but also against green vegetation, {UV} contributes strongly to conspicuousness and sexual dimorphism. This should be further enhanced by the {UV}/bluish early morning skylight ('woodland shade') in which blue tits display Among 18 breeding pairs, there was strong assortative mating with respect to {UV} chroma, but not size, of the crown ornament. We conclude that blue tits are markedly sex dimorphic in their own visual world, and that {UV}/violet coloration probably plays a role in blue tit mate acquisition.},

Ecological factors, such as interactions with rewarding co-flowering species may affect pollinator visitation rates to such deceptive species by influencing pollinator ability to learn to avoid deceptive plants (avoidance learning). We tested the effect of flower colour similarity (similar vs dissimilar) and fine-scale spatial mingling (monospecific vs heterospecific patches) of rewarding and deceptive artificial plants on pollinator visitation in a fully crossed design. We also examined the effect of these factors on learning of initially naive bumblebees. Over time, bumblebees increasingly avoided the deceptive plants, but at a significantly faster rate when deceptive and rewarding plants had dissimilar flower colours than when they were similar. Deceptive plants received more visits when mingled in heterospecific patches with rewarding plants of similar flower colour than when mingled with dissimilar ones. This difference was not significant when rewarding and deceptive plants were spatially separated in monospecific patches. In conclusion, both spatial mingling and flower colour similarity affected pollinator visitation to and avoidance learning of deceptive plants. This proves the validity of artificial experimental systems to study the isolated and joint effect of plant traits, and ecological factors that are crucial for the maintenance of deceptive species in natural populations.},

	abstract = {The extensive literature on natural disturbance in forests is reviewed in terms of the hypotheses: (1) that disturbance is a major force moulding the development, structure and function of forests; and (b) that management of forests for all their benefits can be controlled so that the effects can be contained within those which result from natural disturbance. The causal factors of natural disturbance are both endogenous and exogenous; there are major difficulties in the formal characterization of disturbance and of recovery after disturbance. As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generalizations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpretation of recovery. Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest type and geography. Disturbance by wind is particularly difficult to characterize. Wind varies along a continuum; the blow-down of an individual tree may be mostly due to autogenic processes of ageing and decay, whereas catastrophic hurricanes and cyclones may be defined as wholly exogenous. Nevertheless, the resilience in terms of species diversity of tropical forests following catastrophic disturbance by hurricane is remarkable. A number of studies support the view that the tropical forest in hurricane-prone areas is not a stable steady-state ecosystem but rather that heterogeneity is maintained by catastrophe. The ability to regenerate by suckers and the coincidence of regenerative space and gregarious flowering are important components of the response of rainforest following disturbance. For much of the world, 'fire is the dominant fact of forest history'. As examples, fire and its effects are reviewed for the northern boreal forests, oak-pine forests and north-western sub-alpine forests of North America. The effect of fire on species composition varies with intensity and frequency. That, together with the popular view of fire as unnatural and therefore unacceptable, places great demands on management of forests for all of their benefits, including national parks and reserves. These difficulties also affect management of other ecosystems, such as Mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands where species diversity, productivity and cycles of regeneration and degradation are governed by fire as a natural disturbance. Shifting agriculture is a traditional form of agriculture used by at least 240 million people in the humid tropics. Shifting agriculture, together with wind, lightning and fire, is an exogenous disturbance which has little effect on soil fertility and on structure and composition of the rainforest which re-establishes after abandonment. As the intensity of disturbance of rainforest increases, resilience of the forest decreases and the cuffent problems of extensive clearing for improved pasture and of uncontrolled logging are resulting in degraded ecosystems. Regeneration follows the often extensive death of trees caused by outbreaks of insects in many coniferous forests of northern America. This disturbance by herbivory halts increasing stagnation (as measured by decreasing rates of ecosystem production and nutrient cycling) and reinitiates succession. Other disturbances to forests occur through damage from ice-storms, snow avalanches, erosional and earthquake landslides, and volcanic activity; the development of Nothofagus forests in Chile and New Zealand is determined by such catastrophic mass movements. An extensive literature supports the hypothesis that natural disturbance is fundamental to the development of structure and function of forest ecosystems. It follows that our management of natural forest should be based on an ecological understanding of the processes of natural disturbance. Whether or not we want to do this, and the ''tent to which we want to derive all of the benefits from the forest, including timber, depends on social attitudes. Whereas humanism may treat conservation as the wise husbanding of forests in the interests of social traditions and harmony, animism may give nature unalienable rights. The conclusion from this review is that the ecological framework of natural disturbance and the knowledge of its component processes and effects provides the basis on which we can manage our forests as a renewable resource which can be utilized so that the forests 'retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit'. Nowhere is this management more desperately needed than for the protection of the world's tropical forests, its peoples and their cultures.},

Ornaments used by females to choose mates showed low heritabilities, with the exception of comb and wattle measures. The general absence of heritability suggests that a genetic covariance did not exist at the time of this study between most male ornaments and female preferences for those ornaments. This result is contrary to a key prediction of the arbitrary or Fisherian hypothesis of sexual selection. Comb size and color are condition-dependent traits that reflect short-term changes in health, and comb size of males was positively correlated with offspring weight. Our results are consistent with the expectation of good-genes hypotheses that male ornaments reflect the ability of males to withstand environmental stresses.},

	abstract = {The age, geographic origin and time of major radiation of the butterflies (Hesperioidea + Papilionoidea + Hedyloidea) are largely unknown. The general modern view is that butterflies arose during the Late Jurassic/Cretaceous in the southern hemisphere (southern Pangea/Gondwana before continental breakup), but this is not universally accepted, and is a best guess based largely on circumstantial evidence. The extreme paucity of fossils and lack of modern, higher-level phylogenies of extant monophyletic groups have been major impediments towards determining reliable estimates of either their age or geographic origin. Here we present a phylogenetic and historical biogeographic analysis of a higher butterfly taxon, the swallowtail tribe Troidini. We analysed molecular data for three protein-encoding genes, mitochondrial {ND}5 and {COI}–{COII}, and nuclear {EF}–1α, both separately and in combination using maximum parsimony (with and without character weighting and transition/transversion weighting), maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our sample included representatives of all 10 genera of Troidini and distant ingroup taxa (Baroniinae, Parnassiinae, Graphiini, Papilionini), with Pieridae as outgroup. Analysis of the combined dataset (4326 bp; 1012 parsimony informative characters) recovered the Troidini as a well supported monophyletic group and the monophyly of its two subtribes, Battina and Troidina. The most parsimonious biogeographic hypothesis suggests a southern origin of the tribe in remnant Gondwana (Madagascar–Greater India–Australia–Antarctica–South America) sometime after the rifting and final separation of Africa in the Late Cretaceous ({\textless}90 Mya). Although an ancient vicariance pattern is proposed, at least four relatively recent dispersal/extinction events are needed to reconcile anomalies in distribution, most of which can be explained by geological and climatic events in South-east Asia and Australia during the late Tertiary. Application of a molecular clock based on a rate smoothing programme to estimate various divergence times based on vicariance events, revealed two peculiarities in our biogeographic vicariance model that do not strictly accord with current understanding of the temporal breakup of Gondwana: (1) the troidine fauna of Greater India did not become isolated from Gondwana (Antarctica) until the end of the Cretaceous (c. 65 Mya), well after Madagascar separated from Greater India (84 Mya); and (2) the faunas of Greater India, Australia and South America diverged simultaneously, also at the K/T boundary. A recent published estimate of the time (31 Mya) of divergence between Cressida Swainson (Australia) and Euryades Felder \&amp; Felder (South America) is shown to be in error.},

The cere is a well-known sexual signal in raptors, with carotenoid based pigmentation being indicative of quality. We thus hypothesized that {UV} reflectance also signals quality. Accordingly, we found that in our sample of wild males, the location of the {UV} peak was related to the orangeness of cere and correlated with male body mass and condition (mass corrected for size). Also, males with brighter {UV} were mated to females that laid earlier, as expected if {UV} reflectance relates to a male's quality and attractiveness. Future studies should investigate the relationships between {UV} reflectance and carotenoid pigmentation of cere, and test how {UV} reflectance influences mate choice.},

	abstract = {Many organisms convey false signals to mislead their prey or predators. Some orb-weaving spiders build conspicuous structures on webs called decorations. Web decorations and spider colorations are both suggested to be important signals involved in interactions between spiders and other organisms. There are several hypotheses about the functions of signaling by decorations, among which prey attraction had received much support, but empirical evidence regarding predator defense is controversial. In this study, we conducted field experiments to investigate the effects of spider decoration and coloration on insect interception rates of webs built by Argiope aemula and to evaluate whether presence of decorations may decrease predation risk of spiders. Decorated webs with spiders present had the highest prey interception rate, followed by undecorated webs with spiders, and then undecorated webs without spiders. Such results indicated that decorations of Argiope spiders functioned as visual lures, and so did spiders' bright body colorations. In the field, almost all wasp attack events occurred on medium-sized spiders rather than on large ones. Moreover, medium-sized Arg. aemula on decorated webs received far more attacks than those on undecorated webs. Results of this study thus show that the signals conveyed by decorations can visually lure prey but at the cost of an increased predation risk.},

	abstract = {Background: In California Drosophila simulans, the maternally inherited Riverside strain Wolbachia infection ({wRi}) provides a paradigm for rapid spread of Wolbachia in nature and rapid evolutionary change. {wRi} induces cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}), where crosses between infected males and uninfected females produce reduced egg-hatch. The three parameters governing {wRi} infection-frequency dynamics quantify: the fidelity of maternal transmission, the level of cytoplasmic incompatibility, and the relative fecundity of infected females. We last estimated these parameters in nature in 1993. Here we provide new estimates, under both field and laboratory conditions. Five years ago, we found that {wRi} had apparently evolved over 15 years to enhance the fecundity of infected females; here we examine whether {CI} intensity has also evolved. Methodology/Principal Findings: New estimates using wild-caught flies indicate that the three key parameters have remained relatively stable since the early 1990s. As predicted by our three-parameter model using field-estimated parameter values, population infection frequencies remain about 93\%. Despite this relative stability, laboratory data based on reciprocal crosses and introgression suggest that {wRi} may have evolved to produce less intense {CI} (i.e., higher egg hatch from incompatible crosses). In contrast, we find no evidence that D. simulans has evolved to lower the susceptibility of uninfected females to {CI}. Conclusions/Significance: Evolution of {wRi} that reduces {CI} is consistent with counterintuitive theoretical predictions that within-population selection on {CI}-causing Wolbachia does not act to increase {CI}. Within taxa, {CI} is likely to evolve mainly via pleiotropic effects associated with the primary targets of selection on Wolbachia, i.e., host fecundity and transmission fidelity. Despite continuous, strong selection, D. simulans has not evolved appreciably to suppress {CI}. Our data demonstrate a lack of standing genetic variation for {CI} resistance in the host.},

	abstract = {Few mechanisms exist in nature that effect colour reflectivity, simultaneously high in spectral purity and in intensity, over a strictly limited portion of solid angle above a surface. Fewer still bring about such colour reflectivity with an angle dependence that is distinct from the colour transition associated with conventional multilayer interference. We have discovered that the ventral wings of the butterfly Ancyluris meliboeus exhibit these optical effects, and that they result from remarkable nano-scale architecture on the wing scales of the butterfly. This nano-structure is in the form of high-tilt multilayering that, as a result of abrupt termination of the multilayers, brings about diffraction concurrently with interference. The product is bright structural colour in a limited angular region over the ventral wing surface that enables remarkably strong flicker and colour contrast through minimal wing movement. The visibility effects associated with its colour, in terms of bright and dark zones of the observation hemisphere over the wing surface, are described. We suggest the purpose of the high-contrast ventral wing visibility associated with A. meliboeus is at-rest signalling; this is distinct from the dorsal wing visibility of other species such as those of the genus Morpho, the function of which is largely for in-flight signalling.},

	abstract = {In post-Cambrian time, five events-the end-Ordovician, end-Frasnian in the Late Devonian, end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous-are commonly grouped as the "big five" global intervals of mass extinction. Plotted by magnitude, extinction intensities for all Phanerozoic substages show a continuous distribution, with the five traditionally recognized mass extinctions located in the upper tail. Plotted by time, however, proportional extinctions clearly divide the Phanerozoic Eon into six stratigraphically coherent intervals of alternating high and low extinction intensity. These stratigraphic neighborhoods provide a temporal context for evaluating the intensity of extinction during the "big five" events. Compared with other stages and substages in the same neighborhood, only the end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous extinction intensities appear as outliers. Moreover, when origination and extinction are considered together, only these three of the "big five" events appear to have been generated exclusively by elevated extinction. Low origination contributed more than high extinction to the marked loss of diversity in the late Frasnian and at the end of the Triassic. Therefore, whereas the "big five" events are clearly times when diversity suffered mass depletion, only those at the end of the Ordovician, Permian, and Cretaceous periods unequivocally qualify as globally distinct mass extinctions. Each of the three has a unique pattern of extinction, and the diversity dynamics of these events differ, as well, from the other two major diversity depletions. As mass depletions of diversity have no common effect, common causation seems unlikely.},

Although such behavioural flexibility is regularly observed in the field, it has proven difficult to systematically quantify and predict inter-individual differences in free-living animals. We presented 24 Zenaida doves (Zenaida aurita) on 12 territories with two learning tests in their natural habitat in Barbados. The dove pairs showed high site fidelity and territoriality, allowing us to test individuals repeatedly while accounting for the effects of territorial chases and pair bonds on our learning measures. We used a foraging apparatus that enabled Zenaida doves to access seed, yet excluded other species, and measured doves' performance on colour discrimination and reversal learning tests. We found that (1) doves on all 12 territories passed the two tests; (2) mates within a pair were consistently solvers or scroungers; (3) sex, body condition and territorial chases did not consistently affect learning rates; (4) tameness was a significant negative predictor of learning to feed from the foraging apparatus and (5) scrounging within pairs seemed to facilitate learning. Our study presents a method to quantify intraspecific differences in behavioural flexibility in the field and relate these to individuals' physical and social traits. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Birds frequently display a colourful plumage which is important both in inter and intraespecific communication, and either in sexual and social contexts. In last years some methodologies have been developed to, analyse plumage coloration, but the use of the spectrometers has been particularly important for {UV} range. Measurement of plumage coloration with the spectrometer may be taken directly on the bird or, alternatively by collecting some feathers and measuring them later in the laboratory. However, few is known about the reliability of measures obtained from feathers and whether these are really representative of plumage coloration. We tested this assumption analysing measurements of carotenoids-based coloration components (lightness, chroma and hue) and lutein peak of the yellow breast of the great tit Parus major. We used two spectrometers (Ocean optics and Minolta) which calculate differently the colour components. Our results showed that direct measurement of bird was highly repeatable to determine lightness, chroma and hue for both spectrometers. Similar results we found for collected feathers procedure for both devices. Collected feathers provided high representative measurements of colour values with Minolta spectrometer. Lightness was highly repeatable when we used Ocean optic spectrometer, but chroma and hue were moderate. Lutein peak was also highly repeatable in all cases. The number of feathers used to measure plumage coloration in collected feathers procedure strongly influenced values of colour plumage variables. In general, values of lightness, chroma and hue stabilised when more than 10-15 feathers were used although we found slight differences between spectrometers. However, only four feathers were needed for lutein peak. Thus, our results stress the need to use a minimum number of feathers in measuring plumage coloration from collected feathers.},

	abstract = {This review outlines how eyes of terrestrial vertebrates and insects meet the competing requirements of coding both spatial and spectral information. There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among ‘long-wavelength’ receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision—involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors—is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

Our enzyme electrophoretic Study included 7 geographic populations of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and 7 of the biotype molestus from several European countries. For comparison, 5 populations of Culex quinquefasciatus from Asia, Africa, and North America were examined. The aim was an assessment or the extent of genetic differences between local populations of the biotypes pipiens and molestus versus the degree of differentiation between geographic populations of both groups. Culex torrentium, Cx. modestus, Culex stigmatosoma, and Cidex territans were studied for comparison as taxonomical well-defined species. The population genetic analyses revealed much higher genetic distances between local populations of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus compared to the low differentiation between geographic populations within each taxon. The {UPGMA} analysis and F-statistics position the geographic populations in discrete monophyletic clusters. Gene flow between local populations of the biotypes pipiens and molestus could be shown to be lower than gene flow between geographically distant populations within each of the 2 groups, leading to the conclusion that Cx. pipiens biotype molestus could be a distinct taxon. Culex quinquefasciatus Could be diagnosed as genetically well separated, in particular by the diagnostic enzyme marker {MDH} ({NADP}). Two genetic enzyme markers were identified to differentiate Cx. torrentium from Cx. pipiens s.l. Culex modestus, Cx. stigmatosoma, and Cx. territans showed considerable genetic distances to the species of the Culex pipiens complex and between each other, and several genetic markers could be identified.},

Sequencing of the Wolbachia wsp gene demonstrates that the infections differ from each other and from Wolbachia infections previously reported in mosquitoes. Aedes polynesiensis is the first mosquito identified with a {wMel} Wolbachia type. Intraspecific crosses of infected and aposymbiotic lines generated via antibiotic treatment show that the Wolbachia infections in both species cause high levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility. Interspecific crosses show that the two species are reproductively isolated. However, repeating the interspecific crosses with aposymbiotic mosquito strains demonstrates that the Wolbachia infections play a role in preventing hybrid offspring. We discuss Wolbachia infections in relation to better defining the evolutionary relationships and causes of speciation within the group, understanding the basis for the observed east-to-west gradient in filarial refractoriness, and developing novel genetic control measures.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a debate over various methods that could objectively prioritize conservation value below the species level. Most prominent among these has been the evolutionarily significant unit ({ESU}). We reviewed {ESU} concepts with the aim of proposing a more unified concept that would reconcile opposing views. Like species concepts, conflicting {ESU} concepts are all essentially aiming to define the same thing: segments of species whose divergence can be measured or evaluated by putting differential emphasis on the role of evolutionary forces at varied temporal scales. Thus, differences between {ESU} concepts lie more in the criteria used to define the {ESUs} themselves rather than in their fundamental essence. We provide a context-based framework for delineating {ESUs} which circumvents much of this situation. Rather than embroil in a befuddled debate over an optimal criterion, the key to a solution is accepting that differing criteria will work more dynamically than others and can be used alone or in combination depending on the situation. These assertions constitute the impetus behind adaptive evolutionary conservation. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {The neotropical Drosophila paulistorum superspecies, consisting of at least six geographically overlapping but reproductively isolated semispecies, has been the object of extensive research since at least 1955, when it was initially trapped mid-evolution in flagrant statu nascendi. In this classic system females express strong premating isolation patterns against mates belonging to any other semispecies, and yet uncharacterized microbial reproductive tract symbionts were described triggering hybrid inviability and male sterility. Based on theoretical models and limited experimental data, prime candidates fostering symbiont-driven speciation in arthropods are intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Wolbachia. They are maternally inherited symbionts of many arthropods capable of manipulating host reproductive biology for their own benefits. However, it is an ongoing debate as to whether or not reproductive symbionts are capable of driving host speciation in nature and if so, to what extent. Here we have reevaluated this classic case of infectious speciation by means of present day molecular approaches and artificial symbiont depletion experiments. We have isolated the alpha-proteobacteria Wolbachia as the maternally transmitted core endosymbionts of all D. paulistorum semispecies that have coevolved towards obligate mutualism with their respective native hosts. In hybrids, however, these mutualists transform into pathogens by overreplication causing embryonic inviability and male sterility. We show that experimental reduction in native Wolbachia titer causes alterations in sex ratio, fecundity, and mate discrimination. Our results indicate that formerly designated Mycoplasma-like organisms are most likely Wolbachia that have evolved by becoming essential mutualistic symbionts in their respective natural hosts; they have the potential to trigger pre- and postmating isolation. Furthermore, in light of our new findings, we revisit the concept of infectious speciation and discuss potential mechanisms that can restrict or promote symbiont-induced speciation at post-and prezygotic levels in nature and under artificial laboratory conditions.},

	abstract = {There is a bewildering diversity of signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior. A consideration of how these traits affect each other's evolution explains some of this diversity. Natural selection favors signals, receptors, and signaling behavior that maximize the received signals relative to background noise and minimize signal degradation. Properties of sensory systems bias the direction of evolution of the signals that they receive. For example, females may prefer males whose signals they can perceive more easily, and this will lead to the spread of more easily perceived male traits. Environmental conditions during signal transmission and detection also affect signal perception. Specific environmental conditions will bias the evolutionary direction of behavior, which affects the time and place of signaling as well as microhabitat preferences. Increased specialization of microhabitats and signaling behavior may lead to biased evolution of the sensory systems to work more efficiently. Thus, sensory systems, signals, signaling behavior, and habitat choice are evolutionarily coupled. These suites of traits should coevolve in predictable directions, determined by environmental biophysics, neurobiology, and the genetics of the suites of traits-hence the term "sensory drive." Because conditions vary in space and time, diversity will be generated.},

Reflectance values were measured on museum skins, and interspecific differences were analyzed using the Vorobyev-Osorio avian colour discrimination model. Interspecific distances in the colour space calculated by the model were considerably higher than the threshold for colour discrimination, indicating the presence of colour differences among species that should be detectable by birds. Colour differences between S. hypoxantha and the other three species were the largest. A Discriminant Function Analysis showed that {UV}-wavelength was particularly important in species separation. Our results indicate that female plumage of these four species is considerably divergent in colour; these differences being imperceptible to the human eye, thus representing previously unknown morphological evolution in these species.},

However, manipulation of plumage reflectance is necessary to infer a direct causal link between {UV} plumage and mate choice. We gave both male and female blue tits a choice between a W-reflecting ('{UV}+') partner and a partner whose {UV} plumage reflectance had been removed ('{UV}-'). Male blue tits significantly preferred {UV}+ females. Similarly, female blue tits tended to prefer {UV}-reflecting males, but their {UV}+ preferences were nonsignificant. Neither sex showed a preference when conspecifics were replaced by a heterospecific. This study suggests mutual mate choice but male choice may be more strongly influenced by the visual appearance of potential mates. This is one of a few studies to show male mate preferences and the first demonstration of a direct relationship between {UV} reflectance and;male mate choice.

	abstract = {Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed \$1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.

A genetically diverse starter population was made by allowing six inbred sublines to interbreed. Then three migration patterns were tested: no migration, or one or three immigrants per subpopulation per generation. Variations in four traits were investigated: allozymes, acaricide resistance, diapause, and hatchability. In the allozymes, acaricide resistance, and diapause, genetic variation among subpopulations became high in metapopulations with no migration, but not in the others, which showed that one immigrant is enough to prevent genetic differentiation. Hatchability, which was decreased by interbreeding among the six sublines, gradually recovered in succeeding generations. In metapopulations with no migration, hatchability was reduced again after in-migration at the 15th generation. Different karyotypes or coadapted gene complexes can survive in different subpopulations by genetic drift, and both Wolbachia-infected and -noninfected subpopulations may be selected, which would lead to postzygotic isolation between isolated subpopulations. Our results indicate that sampling effects such as genetic drift or stochastic loss of Wolbachia produce postzygotic isolation in laboratory populations of spider mite.},

However, there is little information about how social experience affects different stages of female choice, for example, pre- versus postcopulatory choice, and whether social experience exerts parallel or divergent effects. Using field crickets, we tested 1) how prior experience with males of varying attractiveness modifies females' precopulatory and postcopulatory mate choice during subsequent mating encounters and 2) whether socially mediated changes in precopulatory choice reinforce or oppose changes in postcopulatory choice. We manipulated the attractiveness of males that females experienced by surgically silencing them and playing back artificially constructed courtship songs during preliminary mating trials. This experience, mediated solely by acoustic signals, had long-term effects on both pre- and postcopulatory choice during subsequent mating trials. Experience with an attractive male 24 h earlier caused females to mount subsequent males more slowly and retain their spermatophore for less time, whereas experience with an unattractive male caused females to mount subsequent males faster and retain their spermatophores for longer. Prior experience had a parallel effect on pre- and postcopulatory choice. The perceived attractiveness of previously encountered males, mediated by their courtship song, appears to strongly influence the reproductive success of subsequent males via alterations in pre- and postcopulatory female choice, confirming key predictions of theoretical models of sexual selection and mate choice that incorporate social effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract Trade-offs in resource allocation have been widely stated as the means by which the honesty of ornamental traits is maintained, but an alternative to this resource trade-off hypothesis is that production of ornamentation is linked to the biochemical efficiency of vital cellular processes. Carotenoids are antioxidants, potentially tying carotenoid-based coloration to the oxidative state of an organism, and some carotenoids are also precursors for vitamin A, which regulates numerous cellular processes. We present a biochemical model for regulation of ornamental coloration based on interdependencies of carotenoid and retinoid biochemistry. We propose that vitamin A regulatory mechanisms, redox systems, and carotenoid pigmentation pathways link carotenoid coloration to oxidative state and to a host of important aspects of performance, such as immune function. The activity of β-carotene ketolase, which catalyzes the oxidation of yellow carotenoids into red carotenoids, is responsive to the states of vitamin A pools and redox systems such that coloration is a direct reflection of the physiological state of an animal. According to the vitamin A–redox hypothesis, feather coloration is associated with a range of performance measures because performance emerges from functionality of the same basic cellular processes that regulate pigmentation. We present the vitamin A–redox hypothesis as a testable alternative hypothesis to the resource trade-off hypothesis for the maintenance of honesty of carotenoid pigmentation.},

We also found that the ratio of color morphs varies among islands within this archipelago, with the populations of Islas Genovesa and Wolf presenting a reversed ratio (90\% brown, and 10\% white) when compared to the majority of Red-footed Boobies populations worldwide. Furthermore, there was no indication of differential habitat association among morphs.

We analysed if eggshell colour is affected by shell structure or pigment level, and whether female traits, laying date, local breeding density, and clutch size affect shell thickness and pore density. We found that eggshell blue-green and {UV} colours were unrelated to shell thickness, pore density and egg size. Eggs with higher concentration of biliverdin showed lower {UV} reflection and higher reflection in the blue-green part of the spectrum. We found that females in better nutritional condition, indicated by their higher mass controlled for tarsus length, laid eggs with thicker shells. It is possible that females in better condition have more time available for searching calcium-rich food, and thus could produce eggs with stronger shells. However, female physical characteristics had no significant relationships with shell porosity. In contrast to our expectation, shell thickness and pore density were unrelated to local breeding density and laying date, though very late and repeat clutches were not sampled in our study. However, we found that eggs in larger clutches had lower pore density than eggs in smaller clutches, which may be expected if the rate of water loss and nest humidity are to remain constant in clutches of different egg numbers.},

Plumage coloration can result from pigments deposited in feathers such as carotenoids and melanins, or can be caused by nano-scale reflective tissues (structurally based coloration), usually producing ultraviolet ({UV}) coloration. Structural colorations remain the least studied of the three most important feather colorations. Previous studies have found a female preference for {UV} color in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, but it is not clear what information this ornament conveys, nor what is the possible cost associated with its production. We investigated possible correlations between immune response and plumage color of wild-type (green) male budgerigars. In particular we measured the wing web swelling resulting from injection of phytohaemagglutinin ({PHA}). We did not detect any correlation between the sedimentation rate and morphological and color variables. We found that {UV} chroma is the best predictor for the cutaneous immune activity. Indeed, male budgerigars with high {UV} reflectance in the breast feathers showed stronger immune responses. These results are consistent with the idea that {UV} colors are special signals conveying information about a bird's condition.},

This might be due to predation, because the primary diurnal predators, birds, utilize {UV} light in foraging and even prefer {UV}-reflecting prey. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment with tethered living moths whose wings were artificially manipulated to reflect ({UV}+, reflection at {UV} wavelength: 15\%) or absorb ({UV}-) {UV} light, keeping longer wavelengths identical. Thus, any difference found in survival rates would be the result of the difference in wing patterns in {UV} spectrum. Significantly more {UV}+ moths than {UV}- ones were eaten in the daytime, but no difference in predation rates could be detected when moths were exposed to nocturnal predators. The different survival rates indicate that {UV} reflection increased predation risk by visually orienting diurnal predators. The lack of difference at night arises from the lack of {UV}-sensitive predators. {UV} wing patterns, even if they are important in intraspecies communication, seem to be costly to diurnal Lepidoptera by attracting predators.},

Bright flange colours and large body size are two traits of offspring that many parents seem to favour, but little is known about how such traits interact. By experimentally altering the difference in mass between nestmates while concurrently blackening the flanges of either the large or small nestlings in the brood, we tested whether large body size could compensate for dull coloration. In three species of cavity nesters (northern flicker, Colaptes auratus, great tit, Parus major, and pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca), doubly disadvantaged offspring that were both small and dull performed the worst, whereas large and bright offspring received the most provisioning, consistent with the idea of additive effects. We used regression to show that, for flickers, dull (blackened) nestlings performed as well as bright nestlings when they were 20\% larger than their bright nestmates. For passerines, dull nestlings had to be 30-40\% larger than bright nestlings to receive equivalent amounts of food from parents. Within-brood differences in mass before manipulation were often greater than this size difference threshold, suggesting that hatching asynchrony has a stronger influence on food allocation than do colour differences among siblings.

Here, we used a comparative approach to examine the relative roles of sexual selection and natural selection in the evolution of sexually dimorphic coloration (dichromatism) and ornamentation in agamid lizards. Sexual dimorphism in head and body size were used as indirect indicators of sexual selection, and habitat type (openness) as an index of natural selection. We examined separately the dichromatism of body regions, 'exposed to' and 'concealed from' visual predators, because these body regions are likely to be subject to different selection pressures. Dichromatism of 'exposed' body regions was significantly associated with habitat type: males were typically more conspicuously coloured than females in closed habitats. By contrast, dichromatism of 'concealed' body regions and ornament dimorphism were positively associated with sexual size dimorphism ({SSD}). When we examined male and female ornamentation separately, however, both were positively associated with habitat openness in addition to snout vent length and head {SSD}. These results suggest that natural selection constrains the evolution of elaborate ornamentation in both sexes as well as sexual dichromatism of body regions exposed to visual predators. By contrast, dichromatism of 'concealed' body regions and degree of ornament dimorphism appear to be driven to a greater degree by sexual selection.},

The peak value and the peak wavelength of the reflection efficiency increase as the vertical periodic thickness increases. The peak value decreases observably, while both of the bandwidth and the peak wavelength increase when the number of the vertical periods decreases. Increase of the horizontal periodic width causes a decrease of the peak value and an increase of the peak wavelength, although the variations are small. The peak value decreases distinctly and the peak wavelength increases as the ambient refractive index increases, which corresponds to the variation in ambient conditions.

However, the effect of plumage maintenance on ornament characteristics and female choice has never been investigated experimentally. In this study we focused on the influence of preening on plumage reflectance and, indirectly, on female preference in the budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus. We measured the effect of preening on the reflectance of previously soiled plumage. Our results suggest that soiling affects plumage reflectance in budgerigars that are prevented from preening and that this effect is particularly pronounced in the {UV} range. In contrast, individuals that were allowed to preen restored their plumage reflectance spectrum to presoiling levels. In a two-choice test, females presented with clean (preened) and soiled (unpreened) males, spent more time near the clean male. These results suggest that female budgerigars are able to discriminate between preened and unpreened males. Further investigations, conducted under various soiling conditions, are necessary to confirm the effect of soiling on plumage reflectance spectrum and to investigate which cues are used by females to discriminate between preened and unpreened males. Such research could reveal whether {UV} feather ornaments, mediated by preening, are special signals conveying information about a bird's current condition.},

	abstract = {Temporal patterns of origination and extinction are essential components of many paleontological studies, but it has been difficult to obtain accurate rate estimates because the observed record of first and last appearances is distorted by the incompleteness of the fossil record. Here I analyze observed first and last appearances of marine animal and microfossil genera in a way that explicitly takes incompleteness and its variation into consideration. This approach allows estimates of true rates of origination and extinction throughout the Phanerozoic. Substantial support is provided for the proposition that most rate peaks in the raw data are real in the sense that they do not arise as a consequence of temporal variability in the overall quality of the fossil record. Even though the existence of rate anomalies is supported, their timing is nevertheless open to question in many cases. If one assumes that rates of origination and extinction are constant through a given stratigraphic interval, then peaks in revised origination rates tend to be displaced backward and extinction peaks forward relative to the peaks in the raw data. If, however, one assumes a model of pulsed turnover, with true originations concentrated at lower interval boundaries and true extinctions concentrated at upper interval boundaries, the apparent timing of extinction peaks is largely reliable at face value. Thus, whereas rate anomalies may well be real, precisely when they occurred is a question that cannot be answered definitively without independent support for a model of smooth versus pulsed rate variation. The pattern of extinction, particularly the major events, is more faithfully represented in the fossil record than that of origination. There is a tendency for the major extinction events to occur during stages in which the quality of the record is relatively high and for recoveries from extinctions to occur when the record is less complete. These results imply that interpretations of origination and extinction history that depend only on the existence of rate anomalies are fairly robust, whereas interpretations of the timing of events and the temporal covariation between origination and extinction may require substantial revision.},

	abstract = {Aim We explore geographic variation in body size within the wingless grasshopper, Phaulacridium vittatum, along a latitudinal gradient, and ask whether melanism can help explain the existence of clinal variation. We test the hypotheses that both male and female grasshoppers will be larger and lighter in colour at lower latitudes, and that reflectance and size will be positively correlated, as predicted by biophysical theory. We then test the hypothesis that variability in size and reflectance is thermally driven, by assessing correlations with temperature and other climatic variables. Location Sixty-one populations were sampled along the east coast of Australia between latitudes 27.63 degrees S and 43.10 degrees S, at elevations ranging from 10 to 2000 m a.s.l. Methods Average reflectance was used as a measure of melanism and femur length as an index of body size for 198 adult grasshoppers. Climate variables were generated by {BIOCLIM} for each collection locality. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify those variables with the most independent influence on grasshopper size and reflectance. Results Overall, there was no simple relationship between size and latitude in P. vittatum. Female body size decreased significantly with latitude, while male body size was largest at intermediate latitudes. Rainfall was the most important climatic variable associated with body size of both males and females. Female body size was also associated with radiation seasonality and male body size with reflectance. The reflectance of females was not correlated with latitude or body size, while male reflectance was significantly higher at intermediate latitudes and positively correlated with body size. Analyses of climate variables showed no significant association with male reflectance, while female reflectance was significantly related to the mean temperature of the driest quarter. Main conclusions Geographic variation in the body size of the wingless grasshopper is best explained in terms of rainfall and radiation seasonality, rather than temperature. However, melanism is also a significant influence on body size in male grasshoppers, suggesting that thermal fitness does play a role in determining adaptive responses to local conditions in this sex.},

	abstract = {Sex-allocation theory predicts that females paired to attractive males should bias the brood sex ratio towards male offspring, as these would inherit the attractiveness of their father. We studied sex allocation based on male ornamentation in blue tits. Brood sex ratios varied with male {UV} coloration in an age-dependent manner. For juvenile males, the proportion of sons increased with increasing {UV} ornamentation, which is in agreement with previous findings from a Swedish population. However, the relationship between {UV} ornamentation and brood sex ratio was reversed for adult males, with females paired to less {UV}-ornamented adult males producing more sons. This pattern fits with the observation that, in our population, less {UV}-ornamented adult males sire the majority of extra-pair young. To test the causality of the association between brood sex ratio and male coloration, we experimentally manipulated crown colour largely within the natural range. We created two groups of males: one with higher and one with lower {UV} reflectance, {UV}(+) and {UV}(-), respectively. Contrary to our expectations, there was no significant treatment effect. However, in {UV}(-), but not {UV}(+) males, the proportion of sons was negatively correlated with male coloration before manipulation. This suggests that the {UV}(-) treatment caused males that were more {UV} ornamented to decline more in attractiveness, as shown in a similar experiment in Sweden. However, given that correlational patterns differ between these populations, similarities in experimental results should not be taken as evidence for consistent patterns of adaptive sex allocation in this species.},

	abstract = {Endosymbionts infect most arthropods and cause a wide variety of phenotypes in their hosts, ranging from obligate mutualists to reproductive parasites. One of the most dramatic forms of reproductive parasitism is male-killing which involves the endosymbiont killing all of the sons of infected females. A phenotype with such a dramatic effect on host fitness is expected to provide strong selection for suppressors of male-killing, yet in many well-studied male-killer/arthropod systems, no suppressors have been found. Plausible explanations for a lack of resistance exist and include cryptic cytoplasmic incompatibility (males that survive male-killing are therefore infected and matings with uninfected females are incompatible) and deleterious pleiotropic effects of altering early embryonic development-the precise time when male-killing often occurs. Here I describe another possible scenario that sidesteps the problem: male killing may arise through an epistatic interaction between an endosymbiont and a paternally acting locus on the X chromosome. Since paternal X chromosomes never find themselves in sons, they never suffer from male-killing and instead enjoy any benefits (decreased sibling competition, inbreeding avoidance) caused by killing males. This scenario allows for the possibility that male-killing arose recently, even if there is no evidence for evolution in the endosymbiont genotype. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The caciques (Cacicus, Clypicterus and Ocyalus; family Icteridae), a group of passerine birds from Central and South America, appear to visually divide into discrete yellow and red color groups. Reflectance spectrometry supported this observation, showing widely separated short and long-wavelength groups corresponding with yellow and red-feathered taxa. Ancestral state reconstructions inferred a yellow ancestral state with two independent changes to red, and no reversals back to yellow. This pattern contrasts with that of another closely related icterid clade, the New World orioles (Icterus), which exhibit a full range of carotenoid colors and have a pattern of evolution that is continuous and extremely labile. To our knowledge, this study is the first to highlight the possibility of different modes of color evolution even among closely related clades. This study also emphasizes the importance of the methods and assumptions of ancestral state reconstruction. In particular, although coloration and other characters can be measured along a continuous scale, they should be reconstructed using discrete methods when data from extant taxa and underlying mechanisms suggest discrete changes.},

The match between nesting substrate and coloration pattern of the eggs in two reproductive groups of the Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica) in the south of Iberian Peninsula was investigated to tests the adaptiveness of colony-site tenacity. The terns showing high colony-site tenacity had 1) a closer match in color between the eggs and the nesting substrate and 2) a lower richness and diversity of egg colors and 3) a lower rate of egg loss from predation than the low colony-site tenacity ones. These results appear to be adaptive, resulting from a long-standing renesting in the same colony-site. However, such mimicry would be difficult to achieve for terns with low site-tenacity, where breeding occur in unstable habitats. These birds were frequently obliged to move from one location to another due to weather irregularity and water level in the reservoirs they bred. In addition, the occasional high predation pressures on both adults and chicks, manifested by the low-tenacity tern group studied, was also involved. The attainment of such egg-crypsis could be an important adaptive advantage favoring colony-site tenacity. In unstable habitats, however, there would be a trade-off between the benefits linked to colony-site tenacity and the negative effects of suboptimal reproduction. Additional experimental design and studies are, however, necessary to confirm these results and predictions.},

In allopatric sexual populations, aspects of sexual behavior may diverge due to sexual selection. In parthenogenetic populations, loss-of-function mutations in genes involved in sexual functionality may be selectively neutral or favored by selection. We assess to what extent these processes have contributed to divergence in female sexual traits in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes in which some populations are infected with parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia bacteria. We find evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Both arrhenotokous males and males derived from thelytokous strains preferred to court females from their own population. This suggests that these populations had already evolved population-specific mating preferences when the latter became parthenogenetic. Thelytokous females did not store sperm efficiently and fertilized very few of their eggs. The nonfertility of thelytokous females was due to mutations in the wasp genome, which must be an effect of mutation accumulation under thelytoky. Divergence in female sexual traits of these two allopatric populations has thus been molded by different forces: independent male/female coevolution while both populations were still sexual, followed by female-only evolution after one population switched to parthenogenesis.

Bees learnt to discriminate similar colours, but with smaller colour distances the frequency of errors increased. This indicates that pollen transfer might occur between flowers with similar colours, even if these colours are distinguishable. The effect of similar colours on reducing foraging accuracy of bees is evident for colour distances high above discrimination threshold, which explains previous field observations showing that bees do not exhibit complete flower constancy unless flower colour between species is distinct. Bees tested in spectrally different illumination conditions experienced a significant decrease in their ability to discriminate between similar colours. The extent to which this happens differs in different areas of colour space, which is consistent with a von Kries-type model of colour constancy. We find that it would be beneficial for plant species to have highly distinctive colour signals to overcome limitations on the bees performance in reliably judging differences between similar colours. An exception to this finding was flowers that varied in shape, in which case bees used this cue to compensate for inaccuracies of colour vision.},

Although the proximate optical mechanisms are often well defined, we know much less about the morphological basis for intraspecific variation in structural colour. 2. Males of the butterfly Colias eurytheme L. possess a thin-film interference array on their dorsal wing scales that generates a bright and iridescent ultraviolet ({UV}) signal. This signal is used in mate choice. 3. Using scanning electron microscopy, we investigated the covariance between nano-structural architecture and {UV} reflectance in samples that were variously subject to either nutrient stress (using a larval host-plant manipulation), or thermal stress (using transient heat and cold shocks during the pupal period). We employed these two stressors to mimic natural stressful processes and to accentuate the variance in {UV} signal characteristics. 4. Two primary structure-reflectance relationships were apparent. First, {UV} brightness increased with the density of scale ridges that bear the interference reflectors. Second, the breadth of above-wing angles for viewing the {UV} covaried with a measure of thin-film angular orientation. These relationships were, however, either limited to, or stronger among, males of the nutrient stress sample. 5. Our results are consistent with a causal effect of developmental stress on nano-structural architecture and henceforth {UV} reflectance, but also suggest that the proximate basis for signal variation may be intimately linked to the nature of prevailing stressors.},

	abstract = {In many birds, females prefer males with the biggest or brightest sexual ornaments. which might reflect a higher phenotypic quality, Such as fewer parasites. Unlike humans, most birds detect near-ultraviolet ({UV}) light, and {UV} signals can play an important role in sexual signalling and mate choice. Using a spectrophotometer, we analysed the colour of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus sexual ornaments (their combs). We first show that combs reflect both in the red (600-700 nm) and {UV} (300-400 mn) part of the spectrum. Second, we investigated whether comb size and colour, and {UV} reflectance in particular, reflected all aspect of individual quality: the intensity of infection by a main nematode parasite, the caecal threadworm Trichostrongylus tenuis. We first analysed comb size and colour variation, and parasite intensity variation, in relation to sex and age. Males had bigger and redder combs than females, but {UV} brightness was greater for female than for male combs. Comb colour also differed between age groups, with Young birds of both sexes showing brighter {UV} than old birds. Young grouse also had fewer T tenuis worms than old grouse. We further tested whether intensity of infection Could be predicted from comb characteristics (size and colour) in male and female red grouse. We found that parasite intensity was not significantly related to comb size or red brightness, but fewer worms were predicted from brighter {UV} in combs, ill both males and females. The results indicate that {UV} reflectance of combs have a quality revealing function and might play an important role in grouse mate choice: {UV} brightness of combs could enable both male and female red grouse to assess the parasite loads of a potential mate.},

	abstract = {By working with very simple images, a number of different visual cues used by the honeybee have been described over the past decades. In most of the work, the bees had no control over the choice of the images, and it was not clear whether they learned the rewarded pattern or the difference between two images. Preferences were known to exist when untrained bees selected one pattern from a variety of them, but because the preferences of the bees were ignored, it was not possible to understand how natural images displaying several cues were detected. The preferences were also essential to make a computer model of the visual system. Therefore experiments were devised to show the order of preference for the known cues in the training situation. Freely flying bees were trained to discriminate between a rewarded target with one pattern on the left side and a different one on the right, versus a white or neutral target. This arrangement gave the bees a choice of what to learn. Tests showed that in some cases they learned two or three cues simultaneously; in other cases the bees learned one, or they preferred to avoid the unrewarded target. By testing with different combinations of patterns, it was possible to put the cues into an order of preference. Of the known cues, loosely or tightly attached to eye coordinates, a black or blue spot was the most preferred, followed by strong modulation caused by edges, the orientation of parallel bars, six equally spaced spokes, a clean white target, and then a square cross and a ring. A patch of blue colour was preferred to yellow. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Preliminary identification of geographically distinct populations as belonging to the same species (N. paspalivorus) was based on their morphological similarity. However, laboratory studies recently conducted have shown large differences in feeding behaviors and biological characteristics among individuals collected from three geographic origins: Brazil (South America), Benin and Ghana (West Africa). As morphologically similar specimens do not necessarily belong to the same species, we evaluated under laboratory conditions, reproductive compatibility between the specimens from three geographic locations to ascertain their conspecificity. Morphological measurements were also made to determine whether there is a means of discriminating between them. Inter-population crosses showed complete reproductive isolation between the three geographic populations, but interpopulation discontinuities in morphometric characters were absent. These results indicate that the tested specimens are distinct biological entities despite morphological similarity. Further molecular genetic studies are therefore proposed, including screening for endosymbionts and assessment of genetic differentiation, to determine the cause of reproductive incompatibility and to clarify the taxonomic relationship between those populations.},

For example, the carotenoid-based plumage coloration of Great tit, Parus major, nestlings is associated with the degree of environmental pollution. Breast feathers of birds in territories exposed to heavy metals are less yellow than those in unpolluted environments. Here we tested two hypotheses that could explain the observed pattern: (I) deficiency of carotenoids in diet, and ({II}) pollution-related changes in transfer of carotenoids to feathers. We manipulated dietary carotenoid levels of nestlings and measured the responses in plumage color and tissue concentrations. Our carotenoid supplementation produced the same response in tissue carotenoid concentrations and plumage color in polluted and unpolluted environments. Variation in heavy metal levels did not explain the variation in tissue (yolk, plasma, and feathers) carotenoid concentrations and was not related to plumage coloration. Instead, the variation in plumage yellowness was associated with the availability of carotenoid-rich caterpillars in territories. Our results support the hypothesis that the primary reason for pollution-related variation in plumage color is carotenoid deficiency in the diet.},

	abstract = {Among the commonest sexual signals of birds are the red-yellow traits pigmented by carotenoids, but how they reliably advertise individual quality remain poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that carotenoid-based signalling is enhanced by testosterone but reduced by parasites, and that the dual action of testosterone on ornament expression and parasite resistance ensures reliable signalling. Tetraonid birds such as the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus have bright red combs pigmented by carotenoids, which function in intra- and inter-sexual selection. In separate experiments, we manipulated a main nematode parasite, Trichostrongylus tenuis (using deparasitation and re-infection) and testosterone (using testosterone or combined Flutamide/{ATD} treatments) in free-living males and investigated effects on plasma carotenoids and comb colour. In untreated males, comb redness positively correlated with plasma carotenoids, testosterone concentration and condition. Plasma carotenoids and comb redness both negatively correlated with T. tenuis abundance. Plasma carotenoids decreased in response to a challenge from T. tenuis, but increased when parasites were reduced. Testosterone enhanced comb redness, but tended to deplete plasma carotenoids. Combined Flutamide and {ATD} treatment had no significant effects on comb colour or plasma carotenoids, indicating that testosterone effects might be direct. Our experiments show contrasted effects of testosterone and nematode parasites on carotenoid-based ornamentation. Testosterone and parasites have well documented interactions in the study model. These, together with the opposite effects that testosterone and parasites have on carotenoid availability and use, would shape optimal levels of signalling, depending on individual quality, and might ensure reliable signalling. Carotenoid-based and testosterone-dependent traits have rarely been linked. Our study provides such a connection and shows that investigating how parasites, testosterone and carotenoids interact helps in the understanding of the evolution and maintenance of honest carotenoid-based signals of health.},

	abstract = {In many insect species, males infected with microbes related to Wolbachia pipientis are "incompatible" with uninfected females. Crosses between infected males and uninfected females produce significantly fewer adult progeny than the other three possible crosses. The incompatibility-inducing microbes are usually maternally transmitted. Thus, incompatibility tends to confer a reproductive advantage on infected females in polymorphic populations, allowing these infections to spread. This paper analyzes selection on parasite and host genes that affect such incompatibility systems. Selection among parasite variants does not act directly on the level of incompatibility with uninfected females. In fact, selection favors rare parasite variants that increase the production of infected progeny by infected mothers, even if these variants reduce incompatibility with uninfected females. However, productivity-reducing parasites that cause partial incompatibility with hosts harboring alternative variants can be favored once they become sufficiently abundant locally. Thus, they may spread spatially by a process analogous to the spread of underdominant chromosome rearrangements. The dynamics of modifier alleles in the host are more difficult to predict, because such alleles will occur in both infected and uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, the relative fecundity of infected females compared to uninfected females, the efficiency of maternal transmission and the mutual compatibility of infected individuals all tend to increase under within-population selection on both host and parasite genes. In addition, selection on host genes favors increased compatibility between infected males and uninfected females. Although vertical transmission tends to harmonize host and parasite evolution, competition among parasite variants will tend to maintain incompatibility.},

The cytoplasmic incompatibility ({CI}) level, fecundity, female ratio, host longevity and host development time were examined. Our results indicate that Wolbachia bacteria had variable effects on the reproduction and fitness of Chinese populations of T. urticae. Variability of {CI} expression within T. urticae ranged from no {CI} to a strong level of {CI} in spite of the low variability of the wsp gene. Relative to uninfected mites, infected females in one of the three populations showed enhanced fecundity associated with the infection of Wolbachia. This is the first report of a Wolbachia infection promoting the fecundity of infected females in T. urticae. Furthermore, we found both positive and negative effects of Wolbachia infection on longevity and the development time.

The results showed that the female, but not the males, presented an above-chance performance for stimuli resembling hue conditions under which tamarins forage (oranges vs greens).

Here we investigate the extent to which Costa Rican butterflies of the family Nymphalidae exhibit polarized wing reflectance and evaluate the types of habitats in which the trait is commonly found. We also examine the degree of polarized reflectance of wing patterns in representative species belonging to the nymphalid subfamilies Charaxinae, Heliconiinae, Morphinae and Nymphalinae. Polarized reflectance was evaluated using museum specimens illuminated with a light source that simulated the spectrum of ambient sunlight and viewed through a polarized filter. Of the 144 species examined, 75 species exhibited polarized reflectance patterns. These species were significantly more likely to occupy forest habitats than open habitats. A concentrated changes test performed on a phylogeny of the Nymphalidae, with the Papilionidae as an outgroup, provides further support for the correlated evolution of polarized iridescence and life in a forest light environment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the production and detection of polarized light may have adaptive communicative value in those species inhabiting forest habitats with complex light conditions. The potential utility of polarized iridescence and iridescent wing coloration within differing ambient spectral environments is discussed to provide a basis for future investigation of the polarized light ecology of butterflies.},

	abstract = {Urazole is a five-membered heterocyclic compound which is isosteric with uracil's hydrogen-bonding segment. Urazole reacts spontaneously with ribose (and other aldoses) to give a mixture of four ribosides alpha and beta pyranosides and furanosides. This reaction occurs in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the reaction of urazole with ribose were determined. In contrast, uracil is completely unreactive with ribose under these conditions. Urazole's unusual reactivity is ascribed to the hydrazine portion of the molecule. Urazole can be synthesized from biuret and hydrazine under prebiotic conditions. The prebiotic synthesis of guanazole, which is isosteric in part to diaminopyrimidine and cytosine, is accomplished from dicyandiamide and hydrazine. Kinetic parameters for both prebiotic reactions were measured. Urazole and guanazole are transparent in the W, which would be a favorable property in the absence of an ozone layer on the early Earth. Urazole makes hydrogen bonds with adenine in {DMSO} similar to those of uracil, as established by H-1 {NMR}. All of these properties make urazole an attractive potential precursor to uracil and guanazole a potential precursor to cytosine in the {RNA} or pre-{RNA} world.},

	abstract = {The Brown Falcon, Falco berigora, is one of Australasia's most common raptors, yet considerable confusion remains over the influence of geography, age and sex on plumage and bare part colouration in this species. To address this issue, 160 immature and adult falcons from an individually marked, closely monitored population were examined. In contrast to previous studies, all were of known sex, age-group and part of the resident population or their offspring. Adult males had significantly lighter upperpart, cap, ventral and underwing covert plumage in comparison with other birds, closely resembling what has previously been described as a 'rufous morph'. Immature females were significantly darker than other ages and sexes in upperpart and underwing covert plumage, resembling descriptions of 'dark morphs'. In contrast, plumage of immature males and adult females tended to be similar and intermediate between these extremes, resembling the 'brown morph'. The buff-tinged, not white, ventral plumage and darker underwing covert plumage of immature males separated them from adult females. Cere and orbital ring colour also differed with sex and age: immature females had the dullest facial bare parts and adult males the brightest, adult females and immature males again being intermediate between the two. The results indicate that most variation in plumage and facial bare part colouration observed in the population could be attributed to age and sex differences as opposed to racial clines or the existence of colour morphs. Moreover, the brighter colours of adult falcons may function as honest signals of quality.},

In this endeavour, scientists from a wide variety of disciplines are involved, such as astronomy, planetary research, organic chemistry, palaeontology and the various subdisciplines of biology including microbial ecology and molecular biology. Space technology plays an important part by offering the opportunity for exploring our solar system, for collecting extraterrestrial samples, and for utilizing the peculiar environment of space as a tool. Exobiological activities include comparison of the overall pattern of chemical evolution of potential precursors of life, in the interstellar medium, and on the planets and small bodies of our solar system; tracing the history of life on Earth back to its roots; deciphering the environments of the planets in our solar system and of their satellites, throughout their history, with regard to their habitability; searching for other planetary systems in our Galaxy and for signals of extraterrestrial civilizations; testing the impact of space environment on survivability of resistant life forms. This evolutionary approach towards understanding the phenomenon of life in the context of cosmic evolution may eventually contribute to a better understanding of the processes regulating the interactions of life with its environment on Earth.},

Here, we investigated whether colour facilitated the learning of the properties of artificial flowers in free-living rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus. Whereas refill rates and sucrose concentrations of flowers were readily learned, we could not detect in the birds' performance an effect of colour on the learning of either floral property. As these results seem unlikely to have been the result of a ceiling effect or an inability to perceive colour variation, we suggest they are due to overshadowing. This apparently counterintuitive result, where birds do not attend to what appears to be a very prominent cue, is consistent with evidence that hummingbirds pay more attention to space than to colour.

Recent evidence supports the theory that the presence of contrasting patterns placed peripherally on an animal's body (disruptive coloration) provides survival advantages. However, no study has tested a key prediction from the early literature that disruptive coloration is effective even when some colour patches do not match the background and have a high contrast with both the background and adjacent pattern elements (disruptive contrast). We test this counter-intuitive idea that conspicuous patterns might aid concealment, using artificial moth-like targets with pattern elements designed to match or mismatch the average luminance (lightness) of the trees on which they were placed. Disruptive coloration was less effective when some pattern elements did not match the background luminance. However, even non-background-matching disruptive patterns reduced predation relative to equivalent non-disruptive patterns or to unpatterned controls. Therefore, concealment may still be achieved even when an animal possesses markings not found in the background. Disruptive coloration may allow animals to exploit backgrounds on which they are not perfectly matched, and to possess conspicuous markings while still retaining a degree of camouflage.},

	abstract = {When honey bees approach blossoms, they are attracted by the color and form of the goal in their visual field, and they use these cues for a successful revisit. Their visual system receives cues by two main types of parallel channels behind the retina; one channel for colors, and a monochrome channel for the orientation and edge of the item in their visual field. In the integration process of these 2 channels, the priority and interaction between them are significant due to the fact that these chromatic and achromatic signals coexist naturally. To investigate this issue, we trained bees to detect form and color and then tested them with combinations of opposite patterns. We observed that the bees chose the correct color but the wrong form pattern in the above experiment as well as for other manipulations as follows. The effect of the color. training for the blue reward pattern differed from that of the green reward pattern. The color pattern choices tended to be more correct if blue was the target during the training process, indicating that the chromatic signal was the main cue in pattern discrimination. In other words, color tended to be the decisive factor in a conflicting situation. In addition, the color blue was preferred over the color green, indicating that color preference was involved in visual recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We document the near-disappearance of song, the sexual signal of crickets, and its replacement with a novel silent morph, in a population subject to strong natural selection by a deadly acoustically orienting parasitoid fly. On the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, more than 90\% of male field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) shifted in less than 20 generations from a normal-wing morphology to a mutated wing that renders males unable to call (flatwing). Flatwing morphology protects male crickets from the parasitoid, which uses song to find hosts, but poses obstacles for mate attraction, since females also use the males' song to locate mates. Field experiments support the hypothesis that flatwings overcome the difficulty of attracting females without song by acting as satellites' to the few remaining callers, showing enhanced phonotaxis to the calling song that increases female encounter rate. Thus, variation in behaviour facilitated establishment of an otherwise maladaptive morphological mutation.},

Female three–spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in many populations show a mating preference for males with a red throat and jaw. It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females in accordance with the Fisher–Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female three–spined and nine–spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context. This result demonstrates a correlation between a sexually selected trait and an intrinsic attraction to red objects, and supports the sensory–exploitation model for the evolution of red nuptial coloration in three–spined sticklebacks.},

	abstract = {The effect of ambush predators on bee populations has so far been neglected on the assumption that predators ambushing at flowers for the arrival of pollinators are too scarce to have significant effects on population numbers. A simple mathematical model can be used to calculate the maximum predator abundance compatible with positive growth of solitary bee populations. Using published data to estimate model parameters, the model shows that medium-sized (20–80 mg dry weight) solitary bees are very sensitive to predation and their populations can hardly grow when 1–2\% of flowers are occupied by ambush predators—a predator abundance well within the range reported in most studies. Smaller and larger bees, on the other hand, can easily cope with normal predator abundances: small bees do not need to visit many flowers to provision an offspring, making it unlikely that they encounter a predator, and large bees are less vulnerable to predator attacks. According to a sensibility analysis, the parameters with the greatest impact on bee population viability are the number of flowers that bees must exploit to provision an offspring and the probability that a bee, upon landing on a predator-harboring flower, is actually captured. It follows that ambush predators cannot be excluded a priori from the list of factors affecting bee diversity and abundance: small changes in the abundance of ambush predators, possibly related to changes in the availability of alternative prey, could have dramatic effects on the viability of medium-sized solitary bees.},

	abstract = {The evolution of exaggerated sexual ornamentation is classically thought to proceed as a compromise between opposing vectors of sexual and natural selection. In colour-based ornamentation, as exhibited by guppies (Poecilia reticulata), heightened trait expression may be beneficial in promoting attractiveness, but costly in terms of predation. Opportunities to reconcile this compromise will exist if there are differences between conspecifics and predators in their sensory systems; in such situations guppies should evolve to exploit the ways in which their ornamentation would appear maximally conspicuous to conspecifics. In the present study, we addressed this hypothesis via a study of geographic variation employing the most sophisticated colour analysis yet attempted for Trinidadian guppies. We made two paired contrasts, one between two Aripo populations that vary in the presence of the potential predator Aequidens pulcher, and another between Quare and Marianne populations that vary in exposure to a predatory prawn, Macrobrachium crenulatum. We predicted that, if ornamentation is constrained by the presence of either predator, then guppy conspicuousness should change most markedly across each of the two paired populations as viewed by that predator. Although disparity analysis of entire colour patterns indicated significant differences in both contrasts, this prediction was most clearly supported for the Marianne/Quare contrast. Marianne fish, which co-exist with prawns, exhibited larger black spots coupled with less extensive, less bright flank iridescence. The brightness reductions are notable because, as the only potential guppy predator with a dedicated ultraviolet ({UV}) photoreceptor, prawns may detect passing male guppies via their {UV}-bright blues, violets and '{UV}/oranges'. We discuss our findings in light of the additional insights that might be obtained by combining spectral assessments and visual modeling with more traditional methods of colour pattern appraisal.

	abstract = {To understand how sexual selection works, it is important to distinguish between the mechanisms underlying mating success. One of the basic questions is to differentiate between the importance of territory-related resources (gained through male-male competition) and male quality in female choice. Few studies, however, have tried to separate these two often intercorrelated variables. We randomized territory quality among male pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, and studied which male traits were associated with their success in female mate choice. Females appeared to choose multiple male traits in the wild when the males were not allowed to choose territories before female choice for males. Males with a long tarsus, large white wing patch and versatile song were favoured by females. In addition, the contrast of ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance in the white wing patch relative to its background, that is, the dorsal brown-black coloration of the males, appeared to be an important mate choice cue. The {UV} reflectance had a stronger effect on pairing success in dark males than in brown ones. An experimental manipulation of the {UV} reflectance revealed that the {UV} coloration of the males appeared to be used in female choice early but not late in the pairing season, which suggests time-dependent plasticity in female choice. Our study thus exemplifies the complexity of mate choice; it is both temporally constrained and dependent on multiple ornaments. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Spider mites often show uni- and bidirectional incompatibilities among populations with and without Wolbachia. Therefore, we surveyed the presence of Wolbachia by {PCR} and then conducted crossing experiments among 25 populations of Panonychus mori to determine how Wolbachia are related to the incompatibility in this species. Five out of the 25 populations were infected with Wolbachia. These five populations were treated with an antibiotic ( rifampicin) to eliminate Wolbachia. We carried out round-robin crosses among 20 Wolbachia-uninfected populations, five infected populations and five rifampicin-treated populations ( 30 x 30 = 900 crosses in total). Incompatibility among P. mori populations was caused by Wolbachia infection, nuclear - cytoplasmic interactions or nuclear - nuclear interactions. Wolbachia-mediated incompatibility was observed in crosses between uninfected females and infected males or between females and males harboring different Wolbachia strains. Nuclear - cytoplasmic interactions may be responsible for the unidirectional incompatibility in crosses between the two northern populations and one of the southern populations. Bidirectional incompatibility caused by nuclear - nuclear interactions was observed in 99 combinations of interpopulation crosses (99/300 = 0.33). Although no geographical trends were detected in the distribution of bidirectionally compatible populations, the results reveal a genetic divergence among P. mori populations.},

Female three–spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in many populations show a mating preference for males with a red throat and jaw. It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females in accordance with the Fisher–Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female three–spined and nine–spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context. This result demonstrates a correlation between a sexually selected trait and an intrinsic attraction to red objects, and supports the sensory–exploitation model for the evolution of red nuptial coloration in three–spined sticklebacks.},

Pigmentation of eggs has evolved as a protective device against predation, but dark-pigmented eggs can be susceptible to overheating when exposed to solar radiation. The Ostrich (Struthio camelus) lays white eggs that are unattended for the first few weeks before incubation, and are quite visible to predators. To evaluate the effect of colour on the surface and core temperatures, we painted some Ostrich eggs dark brown or white, and left some unpainted (control), and exposed all of them directly to the sun during the day. The surface and core temperatures of brown eggs were significantly higher than those of the white-painted and control eggs. In addition, the core temperature of brown eggs exceeded 37.5 degrees C, which is the temperature at which embryo mortality starts to increase. In a second experiment, we placed eggs (brown-painted and control) in various types of vegetation to study their visibility to an observer walking towards them. The white eggs were discovered from a significantly longer distance than the brown eggs, indicating that the predation risk may be much higher for white eggs. The results thus suggest that white eggs minimise overheating and allow the Ostrich to leave its eggs unattended before incubation starts, but they are more susceptible to predation.},

Compared to the training condition the bees took a significantly longer time to complete the task in conditions that simulated either an ultraviolet negative illumination environment, or an illumination environment that represented blue skylight. In a control condition, bees did not derive this cue from spectral information reflected from the dark background material. This result shows that bees can directly perceive spectral changes in illumination conditions, even in the context of a task that does not require colour processing. This potentially enables the visual system of bees to have prior knowledge about the spectral quality of illumination conditions in which they may forage. The findings are discussed in relation to both theoretical models and empirical evidence of colour constancy, and it is concluded that bees can use multiple mechanisms to solve the dilemma posed by having to find colour targets in the spectrally different illumination conditions that exist for insects visiting flowers.},

There was significant response to selection in all four selected lines and significant heritability for sensitivity. An examination of the spectral sensitivity function showed that the form of the response differed between the red and blue lines and among the red lines. Such divergence is likely because there are many different mechanisms allowing response to selection for spectral sensitivity. Diverse mechanisms allow a divergent response by different populations to the same selective pressures.

The rapid radiations of extremely colorful cichlid fish in African lakes have fueled the hypothesis that sexual selection can drive species divergence without geographical isolation. Here we present experimental evidence for a mechanism by which sexual selection becomes divergent: in two sibling species from Lake Victoria, female mating preferences for red and blue male nuptial coloration coincide with their context‐independent sensitivities to red and blue light, which in turn correspond to a difference in ambient light in the natural habitat of the species. These results suggest that natural selection on visual performance, favoring different visual properties in different spectral environments, may lead to divergent sexual selection on male nuptial coloration. This interplay of ecological and sexual selection along a light gradient may provide a mechanism of rapid speciation through divergent sensory drive.},

We hypothesized that beak spots might be sexual ornaments and investigated sexual dichromatism, assortative mating and the possible relationship between beak spot colouration and body condition. Beak colouration was measured with a portable spectroradiometer in 19 breeding pairs of gentoo penguin. Body mass and body mass relative to structural body size were used as estimates of body condition. We found that beak spots were sexually dichromatic, as they were more {UV} in males and more violet in females, but males and females did not mate assortatively in relation to beak spot colouration. Body condition was strongly related to red colouration in males, with individuals in good condition having redder beaks and individuals in poor condition more orange beaks. The beaks of males in good condition were also brighter. Body condition was not significantly related to beak spot colouration in females, so females might show red beak spots because of genetic correlation with the male trait. These results suggest that the red colour of the beak spot has the potential to be a secondary sexual character in males. Interpretation of the sexual dichromatism in the {UV} colour will require further knowledge of the capability of gentoo penguins to discriminate small differences in {UV} wavelengths. In any case, experimental manipulation of beak colouration will be needed to ascertain the role of this trait.},

	abstract = {Solitary bees often form specialised mutualisms with particular plant species, while honeybees are considered to be relatively opportunistic foragers. Thus, it may be expected that solitary bees are more effective pollinators than honeybees when foraging on the same floral resource. To test this, we studied two Wahlenbergia species (Campanulaceae) in South Africa that are visited by both social honeybees and solitary bees, and which are shown here to be genetically self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinator visits for seed production. Contrary to expectation, the solitary bee Lipotriches sp. (Halictidae) and social bee Apis mellifera (Apidae), which were the two most frequent visitors to flowers of the study species, were equally effective pollinators in terms of the consequences of single visits for fruit and seed set. Both bee species preferentially visited female phase flowers, which contain more nectar than male phase flowers. Male solitary bees of several genera frequently shelter overnight in flowers of both Wahlenbergia species, but temporal exclusion experiments showed that this behaviour makes little contribution to either seed production or pollen dispersal (estimated using a dye particle analogue). Manipulation of flower colour using a sunscreen that removed {UV} reflectance strongly reduced visits by both bee groups, while neither group responded to Wahlenbergia floral odour cues in choice tests. This study indicates that while flowers of Wahlenbergia cuspidata and W. krebsii are pollinated exclusively by bees, they are not under strong selection to specialise for pollination by any particular group of bees.},

	abstract = {Eumelanin and pheomelanin are the most common pigments providing color to the integument of vertebrates. While pheomelanogenesis requires high levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione, {GSH}), eumelanogenesis is inhibited by {GSH}. This implies that species that possess the molecular basis to produce large amounts of pheomelanin might be more limited in coping with environmental conditions that generate oxidative stress than species that produce eumelanin. Exposure to ionizing radiation produces free radicals and depletes antioxidant resources. {GSH} is particularly susceptible to radiation, so that species with large proportions of pheomelanic integument may be limited by the availability of {GSH} to combat oxidative stress and may thus suffer more from radiation effects. We tested this hypothesis in 97 species of birds censused in areas with varying levels of radioactive contamination around Chernobyl. After controlling for the effects of carotenoid-based color, body mass and similarity among taxa due to common phylogenetic descent, the proportion of pheomelanic plumage was strongly negatively related to the slope estimates of the relationship between abundance and radiation levels, while no effect of eumelanic color proportion was found. This represents the first report of an effect of the expression of melanin-based coloration on the capacity to resist the effects of ionizing radiation. Population declines were also stronger in species that exhibit carotenoid-based coloration and have large body mass. The magnitude of population declines had a relatively high phylogenetic signal, indicating that certain groups of birds, especially non-corvid passeriforms, are particularly susceptible to suffer from the effects of radioactive contamination due to phylogenetic inertia.},

	abstract = {Previous reports have suggested that the modality-specific sectors of the thalamic reticular nucleus ({TRN}) may become selectively activated as a result of attention being drawn to their respective sensory modalities. Here we used a task that required the discrimination of digging bowls on the basis of their visual (the colour of the bowl) or tactile (the external texture of the bowl) characteristics. We trained rats to perform both modality discriminations, ensuring the equity of exposure to both visual and tactile aspects of the stimuli. On the test day, animals had to perform only one of the modality discriminations for a 1-h period prior to being transcardially perfused and their brains removed and processed for Fos immunocytochemistry. We found that animals that performed the visual discrimination prior to sacrifice demonstrated a selective activation of cells in the visual {TRN}. On the other hand, animals that had performed the tactile discrimination, despite encountering the same stimuli and having received equal visual stimulation as the animals performing the visual discrimination, did not have activation of the visual {TRN}. This evidence suggests that activation of visual {TRN} is a function of visual selective attention, and not merely visual stimulation. Surprisingly, the same was not true for somatic {TRN}, which was not labeled in any animals. It is possible that this lack of a double dissociation is the result of modality-specific differences in the attentional demands of the two discrimination tasks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The potential of life's origin in submarine hydrothermal systems has been evaluated by a number of investigators by conducting high temperature-high pressure experiments involving organic compounds. In the majority of these experiments little attention has been paid to the importance of constraining important parameters, such as the {pH} and the redox state of the system. This is particularly revealed in the apparent difficulties in interpreting experimental data from hydrothermal organic synthesis and stability studies. However, in those cases where common mineral assemblages have been used in an attempt to buffer the {pH} and redox conditions to geologically and geochemically realistic values, theoretical and experimental data seem to converge. The use of mineral buffer assemblages provides a convenient way by which to constrain the experimental conditions. Studies at high temperatures and pressure in the laboratory have revealed a number of reactions that proceed rapidly in hydrothermal fluids, including the Strecker synthesis of amino acids. In other cases, the verification of postulated abiotic reaction mechanisms has not been possible, at least for large molecules such as large fatty acids and hydrocarbons. This includes the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction. High temperature-high pressure experimental methods have been developed and used successfully for a long time in, for example, mineral solubility studies under hydrothermal conditions. By taking advantage of this experimental experience new and, at times, unexpected directions can be taken in bioorganic geochemistry, one being, for instance, primitive two-dimensional information coding. This article critically reviews some of the organic synthesis and stability experiments that have been conducted under simulated submarine hydrothermal conditions. We also discuss some of the theoretical and practical considerations that apply to hydrothermal laboratory studies of organic molecules related to the origin of life on Earth and probably also to the other terrestrial planets.

The reflectance of the iridescent blue scales of Morpho aega is determined by multilayer structures in the scale ridges, causing diffraction in approximately a plane. The purple scales in the dorsal wing tips of the male Colotis regina act similarly as the Morpho scale in the blue, due to multilayers in the ridges, but the scattering in the red occurs as in the Pieris scale, because the scales contain beads with pigment that does not absorb in the red wavelength range.

Colour and pattern were split into components that were separately analysed and subsequently re-grouped via principal component analysis. This revealed four different 'displayed' factors on the dorsal and lateral views versus one 'concealed' factor on the ventral view. Based on the assumption that current patterns of trait variation contain information about the evolutionary history of the phenotype, we correlated these trait components to a neutrally evolving gene fragment (cytochrome b). The concealed factor was significantly correlated with the marker fragment, which identified it as having evolved under genetic drift. Noncorrelation of all displayed factors with the marker may indicate the evolution of colour patterns on dorsum and flanks under selection. In our example, colour pattern should therefore be regarded as a multicomponent signal system. (c) 2008 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia are the most prevalent and influential bacteria described among the insects to date. But despite their significance, we lack an understanding of their evolutionary histories. To describe the evolution of symbioses between Wolbachia and their hosts, we surveyed global collections of two diverse families of insects, the ants and lycaenid butterflies. In total, 54 Wolbachia isolates were typed using a Multi Locus Sequence Typing ({MLST}) approach, in which five unlinked loci were sequenced and analyzed to decipher evolutionary patterns. {AMOVA} and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that related Wolbachia commonly infect related hosts, revealing a pattern of host association that was strongest among strains from the ants. A review of the literature indicated that horizontal transfer is most successful when Wolbachia move between related hosts, suggesting that patterns of host association are driven by specialization on a common physiological background. Aside from providing the broadest and strongest evidence to date for Wolbachia specialization, our findings also reveal that strains from New World ants differ markedly from those in ants from other locations. We, therefore, conclude that both geographic and phylogenetic barriers have promoted evolutionary divergence among these influential symbionts. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Sensitivity peaks were observed at 530 nm (green), 450 nm (blue) and 370 nm ({UV}). Additional extracellular recordings produced a sensitivity function with it peak at 500 urn. It was then tested whether the {CPB} is able to recognize its host plant species by colour by plotting leaf spectra from hosts (Solanum tuberosum Linnaeus 1753, Lycopersicum esculentum Miller 1768 and Solanum ochranthum Humboldt \& Bonpland ex Dunal 1816) and from 35 non-host species in the colour space obtained from the photoreceptor sensitivity functions. The colour ranges of host and non-host leaves overlapped to it large extent, i.e more than the half of the host plant colour points plotted in the colour space came to lie within the colour area demarcated by the non-hosts. Therefore it is concluded that the {CPB}'s set of photoreceptors is not pre-adapted to allow discrimination between hosts and non-hosts by colour, although leaf coloration may still be used by the {CPB} in the process of host finding to facilitate the location of appropriate host plants.},

Here, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of 44 species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families. We found that all species used the same suite: of five polyenal lipochromes (or psittacofulvins) to colour their plumage red, indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots. Species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage, but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared. These polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers, suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet, but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers.},

Oceanic and fragment islands are typically colonized by lineages from adjacent continental margins, resulting in attrition of diversity with distance from the mainland. Here, we show that an exceptional tropical family of harvestmen with a trans-Pacific disjunct distribution has its origin in the Neotropics. We found in a multi-locus phylogenetic analysis that the opilionid family Zalmoxidae, which is distributed in tropical forests on both sides of the Pacific, is a monophyletic entity with basal lineages endemic to Amazonia and Mesoamerica. Indo-Pacific Zalmoxidae constitute a nested clade, indicating a single colonization event. Lineages endemic to putative source regions, including Australia and New Guinea, constitute derived groups. Divergence time estimates and probabilistic ancestral area reconstructions support a Neotropical origin of the group, and a Late Cretaceous (ca 82 Ma) colonization of Australasia out of the Fiji Islands and/or Borneo, which are consistent with a transoceanic dispersal event. Our results suggest that the endemic diversity within traditionally defined zoogeographic boundaries might have more complex evolutionary origins than previously envisioned.},

We performed a two-factor experiment to determine the effects of nutritional stress and xanthophyll supplementation on male dewlap color in N. sagrei. We tested the hypotheses that dewlap color is dependent on access to carotenoids and good nutrition. Contrary to our predictions we found no significant differences among groups of anoles that were either supplemented or not supplemented with carotenoids. Similarly, post-experimental dewlap spectral variation did not differ significantly among groups that were provided a standard or reduced diet.

In the third experiment, mouth redness decreased in saturation when microenvironment temperature increased following a period of cooling.

This paper reviews the architecture of structurally colored scales in 23 species from five genera of papilionid butterflies, describes the two previously unreported scale types, and discusses the developmental and phylogenetic implications of such a great variety of complex and specialized scale types within a single group.},

	abstract = {Understanding the processes underlying the origin of new species is a fundamental problem in evolutionary research. Whilst it has long been recognised that closely related taxa often differ markedly in reproductive characteristics, only relatively recently has sexual selection been evoked as a key promoter of speciation through its ability to generate reproductive isolation ({RI}). Sexual selection potentially can influence the probability that individuals from the same or different populations will reproduce successfully since it shapes precisely those traits involved in mating and reproduction. If reproductive characters diverge along different trajectories, then sexual selection can impact on the evolution of reproductive barriers operating both before and after mating. In this perspective, we consider some new advances in our understanding of the coevolution of male and female sexual signals and receptors and suggest how these developments may provide heretofore neglected insights into the mechanisms by which isolating barriers may emerge. Specifically, we explore how selfish genetic elements ({SGEs}) can mediate pre- and post-copulatory mate choice, thereby influencing gene flow and ultimately population divergence; we examine evidence from studies of intracellular sperm-egg interactions and propose that intracellular gametic incompatibilities may arise after sperm entry into the egg, and thus contribute to {RI}; we review findings from genomic studies demonstrating rapid, adaptive evolution of reproductive genes in both sexes and discuss whether such changes are causal in determining {RI} or simply associated with it; and finally, we consider genetic, developmental and functional mechanisms that might constrain reproductive trait diversification, thereby limiting the scope for reproductive barriers to arise via sexual selection. We hope to stimulate work that will further the understanding of the role sexual selection plays in generating {RI} and ultimately speciation.},

	abstract = {In certain species of moths and butterflies iridescent colours arise from subwavelength diffractive structures. The optical properties of such a structure depend strongly on wavelength, incidence angle and state of polarization of illuminating radiation and on the viewing angle. Such structures can be analyzed only by solving Maxwell's equations, but since analytical solutions exist for only a few simple, highly symmetric structures numerical methods must be employed. We investigated the optical properties of butterfly wings in two dimensions by simulating a scale structure using a high accuracy version of nonstandard finite-difference time-domain algorithm. The simulated structure is a computer-generated model of a certain quasi-periodic arrangement of tree-like structures observed in the transmission electron micrograph ({TEM}) image of a transverse cross-section of a single scale from Morpho butterfly wings. We assumed that the structure is made of a slightly lossy dielectric material. We checked the accuracy and validity of our approach, by computing scattered field intensities due to an infinite cylinder and compared the results with analytical calculations using Mie theory. Next we deduced the wavelength dependence of a real refractive index and an absorption coefficient for the ground scales on the wings of Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly by computing the reflectivity and transmissivity spectrum of a scale at normal incidence, and comparing with experimental measurements. Finally, we calculated the tristimulus values and corresponding colour coordinates for various viewing directions from the scale's far-field reflectivity and transmissivity spectra to characterize its colour rendering abilities.

	abstract = {The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females modify their investment in a breeding attempt according to its reproductive value. One prediction of this hypothesis is that females will increase reproductive investment when mated to high-quality males. In birds, it was shown that females can modulate pre-hatch reproductive investment by manipulating egg and clutch sizes and/or the concentrations of egg internal compounds according to paternal attractiveness. However, the differential allocation of immune factors has seldom been considered, particularly with an experimental approach. The carotenoid-based ornaments can function as reliable signals of quality, indicating better immunity or ability to resist parasites. Thus, numerous studies show that females use the expression of carotenoid-based colour when choosing mates; but the influence of this paternal coloration on maternal investment decisions has seldom been considered and has only been experimentally studied with artificial manipulation of male coloration. Here, we used dietary carotenoid provisioning to manipulate male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) bill coloration, a sexually selected trait, and followed female investment. We show that an increase of male bill coloration positively influenced egg mass and albumen lysozyme concentration. By contrast, yolk carotenoid concentration was not affected by paternal ornamentation. Maternal decisions highlighted in this study may influence chick survival and compel males to maintain carotenoid-based coloration from the mate-choice period until egg-laying has been finished.},

Second, the arrhenotokous and thelytokous strains have been collected sympatrically. Third, crossing experiments between the two strains did not result in fertilized offspring. In addition, the two strains were genetically isolated at the nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Fourth, the two strains showed a sister relationship in nuclear 28S {rRNA} gene. Finally, thelytokous females treated with antibiotics produced Rickettsia-free male offspring of the same reproductive form as arrhenotokous females indicating that the thelytokous strain could have speciated sympatrically from an individual of the arrhenotokous strain.},

	abstract = {Comparative studies of large phylogenies of living and extinct groups have shown that most biodiversity arises from a small number of highly species-rich clades. To understand biodiversity, it is important to examine the history of these clades on geological time scales. This is part of a distinct 'phylogenetic expansion' view of macroevolution, and contrasts with the alternative, non-phylogenetic 'equilibrium' approach to the history of biodiversity. The latter viewpoint focuses on density-dependent models in which all life is described by a single global-scale model, and a case is made here that this approach may be less successful at representing the shape of the evolution of life than the phylogenetic expansion approach. The terrestrial fossil record is patchy, but is adequate for coarse-scale studies of groups such as vertebrates that possess fossilizable hard parts. New methods in phylogenetic analysis, morphometrics and the study of exceptional biotas allow new approaches. Models for diversity regulation through time range from the entirely biotic to the entirely physical, with many intermediates. Tetrapod diversity has risen as a result of the expansion of ecospace, rather than niche subdivision or regional-scale endemicity resulting from continental break-up. Tetrapod communities on land have been remarkably stable and have changed only when there was a revolution in floras (such as the demise of the Carboniferous coal forests, or the Cretaceous radiation of angiosperms) or following particularly severe mass extinction events, such as that at the end of the Permian.},

	abstract = {Structural colors result from an interaction between light and the fine-scale physical structure of a surface, and are often extremely bright, chromatic, and iridescent. Given that these visual features depend upon the aggregate abundance and architectural precision of photonic structures, structurally colored sexual ornaments seem well placed to indicate a range of mate quality characteristics. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the signaling potential of structural coloration in the sexually dimorphic butterfly Colias eurytheme. Males of this species display iridescent ultraviolet ({UV}) markings (arising from multilayer thin films)that overlay a broad area of yellowish-orange pigmentation on their dorsal wing surface. Only the structural {UV} has demonstrated function as a sexual signal; hence we predicted that it should contain more reliable phenotypic and/or genetic quality information, which would be indicated by phenotypic and/or genetically mediated condition dependence. in two split-family breeding experiments we manipulated condition by exposing full siblings to different stressors at two different juvenile life-history stages: (1) reduced larval host-plant quality and (2) transient heat/cold shocks during metamorphosis. Both stressors had profound effects on key developmental and life-history traits. Each stressor also significantly affected male dorsal coloration; thus, the expression of both structural and pigmentary coloration is phenotypically condition dependent. As predicted, the strongest condition dependence was evident in the brightness and angular visibility (i.e., iridescence) of the {UV}. Characteristics of both the iridescent {UV} and pigmentary orange also exhibited moderate-high and significant heritability (H-2 similar to h(2) similar to 0.4-0.9). However, genetic and residual variances did not increase under stress; thus, the observed condition dependence was not genetically mediated as predicted if wing color trait signals "good" genes for the ability to either withstand or circumvent developmental stress. The heightened stress sensitivity of the iridescent {UV} suggests that it offers an informative lifetime indicator of juvenile environments and, henceforth, adult male phenotypic condition, which may be salient to females seeking a highly fertile and/or nutritious male ejaculate.},

	abstract = {Pollinators are confronted with spatial heterogeneity in. oral resources. Acquiring information about their environment enables pollinators to exploit. oral resources optimally, and hence strongly affects their fitness. Despite their evolutionary importance, spatial resource distribution and social information use have never been addressed in a plant-pollinator framework. We experimentally tested the effects of inadvertent social information ({ISI}) use (without or with an experienced demonstrator) in relation to spatial flower distribution (random or patchy) in foraging Bombus terrestris. We studied naive bees' associative learning when confronted with rewarding and nonrewarding flowers that differed slightly in colour, reproducing the natural mimicry of deceptive species. Naive bees were more efficient foragers with than without a demonstrator in the patchy flower distribution, suggesting that they used {ISI} from conspecifics, probably in the form of social attraction at the patch scale. In the random flower distribution, however, {ISI} did not improve performance of naive bees, and could not replace individual sampling. Analyses of nonrewarding intraspecific transitions indicate that the efficiency of naive bees in deceptive species pollination was lowered when rewarding and nonrewarding inflorescences were patchily distributed and especially when bees relied on {ISI}. Thus, spatial flower distribution and {ISI} availability interact in determining pollinator behaviour, which has important consequences for plant community pollination. This suggests that bumblebees are adapted to exploit patchily distributed resources socially, a characteristic that might be exploited by deceptive plant species. By coupling behavioural and community ecology, this study offers promising perspectives for cognitive ecology studies in plant-pollinator interactions.

These results suggest that jungle crows have a high retention capacity for learned information, at least after a 10-month retention interval and make no or very few errors. This study is the first to show long-term memory capacity of color stimuli in corvids following a brief training that memory rather than rehearsal was apparent. Memory of visual color information is vital for exploitation of biological resources in crows. We suspect that jungle crows could remember the learned color discrimination task even after a much longer retention interval.},

	abstract = {In diverse animal taxa, offspring produce signals that serve the function of soliciting parents to provision care. In birds, such 'begging' signals may consist of vocal and visual displays that influence parental decisions on allocation of critical food resources among the progeny. According to sex allocation theory, parents may gain fitness benefits from favouring offspring of either sex, depending on ecological conditions or parental quality. However, adaptive allocation of care can occur only if parents can identify the sex of their offspring, which, however, appear to be sexually monomorphic in most bird species. Begging displays may be a vehicle of such sex-specific signals. However, only very few studies have investigated sex differences in begging calls and none has analysed sex differences in a main component of begging displays of passerine birds, that is, mouth coloration. In the present study, we show that male nestling barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, have more brightly coloured mouths than their female broodmates early in the nestling period. Sex differences in mouth coloration disappear later in the nestling period when, however, differences in begging calls develop, confirming the results of a previous study. Thus, begging displays carry sex-specific components whose nature ( visual or acoustic) changes during offspring ontogeny and might mediate the differential access of male and female offspring to parental care observed in this species, particularly under adverse rearing conditions.

	abstract = {The crab spider Xysticus sabulosus ({HAHN}, 1832) is a sit-and-wait predator, typical for sandy habitats in Europe and Flanders. In the Flemish coastal dunes, the species is very abundant in grey and blond dunes. Its abdominal and cephalothorical colour varies from almost completely white to dark brown. During autumn 2001, we investigated crypsis as a function of the occupied micro- and macrohabitat. Our results indicate that (1) Colouration differs between the populations. The species is darker in a grey dune completely covered with dried (brown) mosses and in a humid dune slack covered with algae, than in populations from a sea inlet and from a blond dune. The colouration of a population from a grey dune with mosses, lichens and bare sand is intermediate. (2) Individual cephalothoracal colouration is, in contrast to abdominal colouration, related to microhabitat selection : individuals with darker cephalothoraxes occupy hunting sites with a higher coverage of mosses, while those with a pale one are found in microhabitats with a high amount of nude sand. The observed spider colour-environment covariation between populations is probably the result of natural selection or colour alteration during the juvenile development. Further research on these possible underlying mechanisms remains, however, necessary.},

We investigated weight and achromatic color (color, henceforth) discrimination in bonobos, gorillas and orangutans, using the exchange paradigm in which subjects have to give objects to the experimenter in order to receive a reward. Unlike previous studies, subjects were not trained to lift objects because lifting the objects was an integral part of the exchange procedure. This methodology also allowed us a direct comparison between visual and weight discrimination. We presented 12 subjects (5 bonobos, 2 gorillas and 5 orangutans) with two sets of objects corresponding to two conditions. The objects in the color condition (white/black) differed only in color and those in the weight condition (light/heavy) differed only in weight. Five apes learned to discriminate weight and six to discriminate color. Subjects learned color discrimination faster than weight discrimination. Our results suggest that bonobos and orangutans are sensitive to differences in weight and able to learn discriminating objects that differ in this property.},

These findings show that new objects are not necessary for attention capture. The present study tested whether they are even sufficient. That is, does a new object attract attention because the visual system is sensitive to new objects or because it is sensitive to the transients that new objects create? In two experiments using a visual search task, new objects did not capture attention unless they created a strong local luminance transient.},

Because color patterns are used in communication, selection for signal efficacy, relative to the intended receiver's visual system, may explain and predict the direction of evolution. We investigated this in bowerbirds, whose color patterns consist of plumage, bower structure, and ornaments and whose visual displays are presented under predictable visual conditions. We used data on avian vision, environmental conditions, color pattern properties, and an estimate of the bowerbird phylogeny to test hypotheses about evolutionary effects of visual processing. Different components of the color pattern evolve differently. Plumage sexual dimorphism increased and then decreased, while overall (plumage plus bower) visual contrast increased. The use of bowers allows relative crypsis of the bird but increased efficacy of the signal as a whole. Ornaments do not elaborate existing plumage features but instead are innovations (new color schemes) that increase signal efficacy. Isolation between species could be facilitated by plumage but not ornaments, because we observed character displacement only in plumage. Bowerbird color pattern evolution is at least partially predictable from the function of the visual system and from knowledge of different functions of different components of the color patterns. This provides clues to how more constrained visual signaling systems may evolve.},

It has been shown that carotenoid-based coloration in birds reflects both individual quality and foraging ability. Because the body condition of nestlings usually depends on the capacity of their parents to feed them, I predicted that, independent of sex, those individuals with the most exaggerated carotenoid-based plumage coloration should raise offspring in better health. I found that although, in my study population, the smallest females were paired with the largest males, the brightest females were paired with the brightest and most intensely coloured males. I used body condition and T-cell-mediated immune response of nestlings as measures of their health status. Generalized mixed models showed that brighter and more-yellow adults reared offspring in better than average condition and immune response. Older males and smaller females were also able to raise offspring with better immune response. All these results suggest that the carotenoid-based plumage coloration of parents is somehow linked with individual quality, as it presents a significant and positive correlation with the health status of their growing chicks. Thus, the brightest and more intensely coloured individuals raised the healthiest offspring.},

	abstract = {Many birds display carotenoid-based ornaments, which are typically considered to be honest indicators of individual health and condition. Experimental work on male red-shouldered widowbirds, Euplectes axillaris, has demonstrated a function of the carotenoid-based epaulettes in male contests and territory acquisition. Using two experiments, we investigated whether the natural variation in this colour signal reveals male competitive ability. Males with larger and redder (more longwave) epaulettes established territories to the exclusion of males with smaller and less red signals, which formed a large population of 'floaters'. In an experiment in which we removed 42 resident males, these floaters rapidly filled up vacant territories. Among removed birds held in captivity, residents strongly dominated floaters in dyadic contests over access to an easily monopolized feeder (i.e. outside the context of territory defence). Only epaulette size predicted the outcome of these male contests. In addition, when competitors were experimentally given similar epaulette signals (removed or painted red to the average population size), the males were involved in more aggressive interactions than during unmanipulated contests, but residents continued to outcompete floaters. On release (after 8 days) to the breeding grounds, most residents (88\%) rapidly reclaimed their territories from replacements. Combined, these results suggest that some intrinsic 'resource-holding potential', associated with the variation in epaulette signal, is primarily responsible for residents dominating nonresidents.

Selection for efficient signal perception should favor the evolution of traits that exhibit an optimal balance between these two design components. We examined the evolution of signal design in the colorful plumage ornaments of manakins (Aves: Pipridae). We used a model of avian color space to quantify how differences in plumage coloration would be perceived by a typical passerine bird and examined patterns of coloration across 50 species of manakin. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we show that plumage contrast against the background increases with sexual dichromatism in males but not females, suggesting that sexual selection has favored the evolution of male plumage ornaments that enhance signal efficacy. Plumage contrast within individuals also increased with dichromatism in males but not females. Finally, plumage colors produced by different mechanisms, which may reveal different aspects of quality, resulted in different degrees of contrast against the background. Our findings suggest that selection for signal efficacy and content may sometimes be opposing, creating a trade‐off between these two components of signal design. Manakins may mediate this trade‐off by combining multiple plumage ornaments that differ in efficacy and content.},

Under the hypothesis that fruit traits have evolved in response to different sets of selective pressures by disparate types of seed dispersers (the dispersal syndromes hypothesis), we test for two dispersal syndromes, defined as groups of fruit traits that appear together more often than expected by chance. (1) Bird syndrome fruits are brightly colored and small, because birds have acute color vision, and commonly swallow fruits whole. (2) Mammal syndrome fruits are dull-colored and larger on average than bird syndrome fruits, because mammals do not rely heavily on visual cues for finding fruits, and can eat fruits piecemeal. If, instead, phylogenetic inertia determines the co-occurrence of fruit size and color, we will observe that specific combinations of size and color evolved in a small number of ancestral species. We performed a comparative analysis of fruit traits for 64 species of Ficus (Moraceae), based on a phylogeny we constructed using nuclear ribosomal {DNA}. Using a concentrated changes test and assuming fruit color is an independent variable, we found that small-sized fruits evolve on branches with red and purple figs, as predicted by the dispersal syndromes hypothesis. When using diameter as the independent variable, results vary with the combination of algorithms used, which is discussed in detail. A likelihood ratio test confirms the pattern found with the concentrated changes test using color as the independent variable. These results support the dispersal syndromes hypothesis.},

Classification of a species as sexually monochromatic (identical coloration between the sexes) has traditionally been based on human visual perception. Research over the past two decades has shown that birds see each other and the world differently than their human investigators; these visual differences, combined with objective color measurements, suggest that traditional assessments of plumage coloration may be questionable from an avian visual perspective (Cuthill et al. 1999). 1 tested the avian reality of human categorization of sexually monochromatic plumages for North American passerines. I found, on the basis of plumage-reflectance data and modeled avian color-discrimination thresholds, that 91.6\% of the presumed sexually monochromatic species I sampled are sexually dichromatic to birds, which confirms the rarity of sexually monochromatic bird species. This study informs future work as to potential sources of plumage signals hidden from human observers and generates testable predictions regarding avian sex-recognition via plumage signals.

In this study, we use 15 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to estimate population structure and gene flow among populations from across the range of D. pumilio and a causal modelling framework to statistically test 12 hypotheses regarding the geographic and phenotypic variables that explain genetic differentiation within this system. Our results demonstrate that the genetic distance between populations is most strongly associated with differences in dorsal coloration. Previous experimental studies have shown that phenotypic differences can result in sexual and natural selection against non-native phenotypes, and our results now show that these forces lead to genetic isolation between different colour morphs in the wild, presenting a potential case of incipient speciation through selection.},

	abstract = {Demonstrations of interactions between diverse selective forces on bright coloration in defended species are rare. Recent work has suggested that not only do the bright colours of Neotropical poison frogs serve to deter predators, but they also play a role in sexual selection, with females preferring males similar to themselves. These studies report an interaction between the selective forces of mate choice and predation. However, evidence demonstrating phenotypic discrimination by potential predators on these polymorphic species is lacking. The possibility remains that visual (avian) predators possess an inherent avoidance of brightly coloured diurnal anurans and purifying selection against novel phenotypes within populations is due solely to non-random mating. Here, we examine the influence of predation on phenotypic variation in a polymorphic species of poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. Using clay models, we demonstrate a purifying role for predator selection, as brightly coloured novel forms are more likely to suffer an attack than both local aposematic and cryptic forms. Additionally, local aposematic forms are attacked, though infrequently, indicating ongoing testing/learning and a lack of innate avoidance. These results demonstrate predator-driven phenotypic purification within populations and suggest colour patterns of poison frogs may truly represent a 'magic trait'.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia infect a variety of arthropod and nematode hosts, but in arthropods, host phylogenetic relationships are usually poor predictors of strain similarity. This suggests that new infections are often established by horizontal transmission. To gain insight into the factors affecting the probability of horizontal transmission among host species, we ask how host phylogeny, geographical distribution and ecology affect patterns of Wolbachia strain similarity. We used multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}) to characterize Wolbachia strain similarity among dipteran hosts associated with fleshy mushrooms. Wolbachia Supergroup A was more common than Supergroup B in Diptera, and also more common in mycophagous than non-mycophagous Diptera. Within Supergroup A, host family within Diptera had no effect on strain similarity, and there was no tendency for Wolbachia strains from sympatric host species to be more similar to one another than to strains from hosts in different biogeographical realms. Supergroup A strains differed between mycophagous and non-mycophagous Diptera more than expected by chance, suggesting that ecological associations can facilitate horizontal transmission of Wolbachia within mycophagous fly communities. For Supergroup B, there were no significant associations between strain similarity and host phylogeny, biogeography, or ecology. We identified only two cases in which closely related hosts carried closely related Wolbachia strains, evidence that Wolbachia-host co-speciation or early introgression can occur but may not be a major contributor to overall strain diversity. Our results suggest that horizontal transmission of Wolbachia can be influenced by host ecology, thus leading to partial restriction of Wolbachia strains or strain groups to particular guilds of insects.},

We took morphometric measures of shiny cowbird eggs found in nests of mockingbirds and wrens and analysed their coloration using digital photography and reflectance spectrometry. We found that shiny cowbird eggs found in mockingbird nests were wider and more asymmetric than those found in wren nests. In addition, cowbird eggs coming from mockingbird nests were brighter and had higher relative red reflectance than those coming from wren nests.

In some dragonflies, whereas females and young males are yellowish in color, aged males turn vivid red upon sexual maturation. The male-specific coloration plays pivotal roles in, for example, mating and territoriality, but molecular basis of the sex-related transition in body coloration of the dragonflies has been poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that yellow/red color changes in the dragonflies are regulated by redox states of epidermal ommochrome pigments. Ratios of reduced-form pigments to oxidized-form pigments were significantly higher in red mature males than yellow females and immature males. The ommochrome pigments extracted from the dragonflies changed color according to redox conditions in vitro: from red to yellow in the presence of oxidant and from yellow to red in the presence of reductant. By injecting the reductant solution into live insects, the yellow-to-red color change was experimentally reproduced in vivo in immature males and mature females. Discontinuous yellow/red mosaicism was observed in body coloration of gynandromorphic dragonflies, suggesting a cell-autonomous regulation over the redox states of the ommochrome pigments. Our finding extends the mechanical repertoire of pigment-based body color change in animals, and highlights an impressively simple molecular mechanism that regulates an ecologically important color trait.},

Male Eastern Fence Lizards, Sceloporus undulatus, possess sex-specific dorsal and ventral coloration, including vivid blue badges on their throat and abdomen, which they behaviorally display to conspecifics. The presence of abdominal badges serves as a signal of an individual's sex, but the significance of badge and integument coloration for signaling fitness traits is unknown. We tested for associations between coloration (color of the dorsal surface, chest, and abdominal and throat badges, as well as relative badge size) and a range of fitness-relevant morphological traits (body size and condition, tail and hind-limb length, and head size) in male Eastern Fence Lizards from two sites. Larger males have darker colored abdominal badges and relatively larger abdominal and throat badges. Males with longer tails and wider heads have darker dorsal coloration, and there is a correlation between head length and the color of the black abdominal badges, but this is not consistent between sites. Adults also have darker chest and dorsal coloration than do juveniles. These relationships suggest that S. undulatus color may signal competitive ability to male opponents. However, if this were the case, we would expect body condition and limb length, morphological measures that are tightly correlated with these fitness traits, to also correlate with coloration. This was not evident from our data. Therefore, despite significant variation in coloration of male S. undulatus, it is unlikely to reflect fitness associated with the traits measured in this study.},

We perform one of the most extensive series of wing pattern manipulations in butterflies, dissecting every component of the 'bulls-eye' eyespot patterns in both ventral and dorsal wing surfaces of males to test the trait's appeal to females. We conclude that females select males on the basis of the size and brightness of the dorsal eyespot's ultraviolet reflecting pupils. Pupil absence is strongly selected against, as are artificially enlarged pupils. Small to intermediate (normal sized) pupils seem to function equally well. This work contradicts earlier experiments that suggest that the size of dorsal eyespots plays a role in female choice and explains why male dorsal eyespots are very variable in size and often have indistinct rings of coloration, as the only feature under selection by females seems to be the central white pupil. We propose that sexual selection by female choice, rather than predator avoidance, may have been an important selective factor in the early stages of eyespot evolution in ancestral Lepidopteran lineages.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The sensory bias model of sexual selection posits that female mating preferences are by‐products of natural selection on sensory systems. Although sensory bias was proposed 20 years ago, its critical assumptions remain untested. This paradox arises because sensory bias has been used to explain two different phenomena. First, it has been used as a hypothesis about signal design, that is, that males evolve traits that stimulate female sensory systems. Second, sensory bias has been used as a hypothesis for the evolution of female preference itself, that is, to explain why females exhibit particular preferences. We focus on this second facet. First, we clarify the unique features of sensory bias relative to the alternative models by considering each in the same quantitative genetic framework. The key assumptions of sensory bias are that natural selection is the predominant evolutionary mechanism that affects preference and that sexual selection on preferences is quantitatively negligible. We describe four studies that would test these assumptions and review what we can and cannot infer about sensory bias from existing studies. We suggest that the importance of sensory bias as an explanation for the evolution of female preferences remains to be determined.},

In this study, we assessed monarchs abilities to track changing nectar sources over time and to retain learned information presented in two conditioning schedules. Non-preferred (blue and red) and preferred (yellow) artificial flowers were concomitantly offered to monarchs in a three-phase experiment. In each phase, flowers of only one color contained sucrose solution, while the others contained water. The rewarding color was changed in each phase. Instantaneous observations were made to assess butterfly visits to each color during each phase; continuous observations over the first 90 similar to min of a new phase allowed us to look in more detail at the transition process. Overall, monarchs tracked sucrose availability, visiting the rewarding flowers more often than the unrewarding ones, regardless of innate preferences. However, butterflies reverted to innate color preferences when the newly rewarding color was different from the initial trained color. In a second experiment, memory decay was compared for butterflies trained according to two schedules: single training (sucrose solution in red vs. water in blue artificial flowers in one 15-min session per day) or intermittent training (as above, but in two 7.5-min sessions per day). Afterwards, butterflies were tested on alternate days for a week in arrays containing unrewarding models of both colors. Following either training schedule, memory persisted for at least 3 similar to d after reinforcement ceased. Our findings reveal that monarchs are able to change their feeding responses according to the flowers reward status despite innate preferences, as well as to retain flower information for about half a week regardless of the conditioning dynamics.},

	abstract = {Commensal bacteria can induce sexual isolation between populations of Drosophila. This phenomenon has implications for speciation, and raises questions about its behavioral and developmental mechanisms, which are not yet known. In this Extra View, we discuss related work by others, bearing directly on these issues, and we speculate about how bacteria might influence fly behavior. There are many reports of interaction between Drosophila and their microbiota that significantly impacts mating preferences. Sexual isolation can be enhanced or reduced by altering the culture media, or the microbiota inhabiting those media. More dramatically, the endosymbiont Wolbachia has induced strong mate preferences in some instances. While a sudden, ecologically induced shift in mating preferences falls far short of the changes required for speciation, it might be a first step in that direction. We hypothesize that bacteria-induced sexual isolation is caused by chemosensory cues. In our experiments, bacteria altered the profile of cuticular hydrocarbons, which function as sex pheromones. Commensal bacteria may act directly on these hydrocarbons, or they may affect their synthesis. Alternatively, bacterial metabolites might perfume the flies in ways that affect mate choice. In that event, habituation or conditioning likely plays a role.},

After a few such training runs, a butterfly was presented with the training colour randomly positioned within an array of disks of other colours, but with no sucrose solution. The results indicate that the butterflies learn rapidly to select the training colour reliably among different colours. The training colour was also correctly selected when it was covered with neutral density filters to reduce its brightness, or even when the colour was presented together with disks of a variety of shades of grey. These results demonstrate convincingly, for the first time, that a butterfly has true colour vision.},

	abstract = {Peak shift" is a behavioral response bias arising from discrimination learning in which animals display a directional, but limited, preference for or avoidance of unusual stimuli. Its hypothesized evolutionary relevance has been primarily in the realm of aposematic coloration and limited sexual dimorphism. Here, we develop a novel functional approach to peak shift, based on signal detection theory, which characterizes the response bias as arising from uncertainty about stimulus appearance, frequency, and quality. This approach allows the influence of peak shift to be generalized to the evolution of signals in a variety of domains and sensory modalities. The approach is illustrated with a bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) discrimination learning experiment. Bees exhibited peak shift while foraging in an artificial Batesian mimicry system. Changes in flower abundance, color distribution, and visitation reward induced bees to preferentially visit novel flower colors that reduced the risk of flower-type misidentification. Under conditions of signal uncertainty, peak shift results in visitation to rarer, but more easily distinguished, morphological variants of rewarding species in preference to their average morphology. Peak shift is a common and taxonomically widespread phenomenon. This example of the possible role of peak shift in signal evolution can be generalized to other systems in which a signal receiver learns to make choices in situations in which signal variation is linked to the sender's reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Melanin-based ornaments often function as signals in male-male competition, whereas carotenoid-based ornaments appear to be important in female mate choice. This difference in function is thought to occur because carotenoid pigments are more costly to produce than melanins and are thus more reliable indicators of male quality. We examined the role of melanin- and carotenoid-based ornaments in male-male competition and female choice in the common yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas, a sexually dichromatic passerine. Males display a black facial mask produced by melanin pigmentation and a bright yellow bib (throat, breast and belly) produced by carotenoid pigmentation. In controlled aviary experiments, mask size was the best predictor of both male-male competition and female mate choice, and, therefore, mask size may be regarded as an ornament of dual function. These dual functions may help to maintain the reliability of mask size as an indicator of male quality, despite the potentially low cost of production. The size of the bib was unrelated to male-male competition or female choice, but there was a tendency for females to prefer males with more colourful bibs. We propose that the black mask is important in competition for territories with other males and for attracting females. Our results highlight the need for more studies of the mechanisms of sexual selection in species with ornaments composed of different pigment types.},

	abstract = {Bacterial endosymbionts of insects have long been implicated in the phenomenon of cytoplasmic incompatibility, in which certain crosses between symbiont-infected individuals lead to embryonic death or sex ratio distortion. The taxonomic position of these bacteria has, however, not been known with any certainty. Similarly, the relatedness of the bacteria infecting various insect hosts has been unclear. The inability to grow these bacteria on defined cell-free medium has been the major factor underlying these uncertainties. We circumvented this problem by selective {PCR} amplification and subsequent sequencing of the symbiont 16S {rRNA} genes directly from infected insect tissue. Maximum parsimony analysis of these sequences indicates that the symbionts belong in the alpha-subdivision of the Proteobacteria, where they are most closely related to the Rickettsia and their relatives. They are all closely related to each other and are assigned to the type species Wolbachia pipientis. Lack of congruence between the phylogeny of the symbionts and their insect hosts suggest that horizontal transfer of symbionts between insect species may occur. Comparison of the sequences for W. pipientis and for Wolbachia persica, an endosymbiont of ticks, shows that the genus Wolbachia is polyphyletic. A {PCR} assay based on 16S primers was designed for the detection of W. pipientis in insect tissue, and initial screening of insects indicates that cytoplasmic incompatibility may be a more general phenomenon in insects than is currently recognized.},

This appears to have been largely a function of sorting among higher taxa (especially classes), which exhibit characteristic rates of speciation (and extinction) that differ among them by nearly an order of magnitude. Secular decline of origination rates is hardly constant, however; many positive deviations reflect accelerated speciation during rebounds from mass extinctions. There has also been general decline in rates of speciation within major taxa through their histories, although rates have tended to remain higher among members in tropical regions. Finally, pulses of speciation appear sometimes to be associated with climate change, although moderate oscillations of climate do not necessarily promote speciation despite forcing changes in species' geographical ranges.},

We address this question using the interaction between bumblebees and the colour-changing crab spider Misumena vatia which can camouflage itself on some flowers. In laboratory experiments, we exposed bumblebees to an array of flowers concealing robotic predators (a trapping mechanism combined with a 3D life-sized model of a crab spider or a circle). Groups of bees were trained to avoid either cryptic yellow spiders or yellow circles (equal area to the spiders) or remained predator naive. The bees were then exposed to a new patch of white flowers containing some cryptic predators (either white spiders, white circles or a mixture of both). We monitored individual foraging choices and used a 3D video tracking system to quantify the bees' flight behaviour. The bees trained to avoid cryptic spiders, chose 40\% fewer spider-harbouring flowers than expected by chance, but were indifferent to cryptic circles. They also aborted a higher proportion of landings on flowers harbouring spiders, ultimately feeding from half as many 'dangerous' flowers as naive bees. Previous encounters with cryptic spiders also influenced the flight behaviour of bees in the new flower patch. Experienced bees spent more time inspecting the flowers they chose to reject (both with and without concealed spiders) and scanned from side to side more in front of the flowers to facilitate predator detection. We conclude that bees disentangle shape from colour cues and thus can form a generalised search image for spider shapes, independent of colour.},

	abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary theories predict that parasitism and mutualism are not fixed endpoints of the symbiotic spectrum. Rather, parasitism and mutualism may be host or environment dependent, induced by the same genetic machinery, and shifted due to selection. These models presume the existence of genetic or environmental variation that can spur incipient changes in symbiotic lifestyle. However, for obligate intracellular bacteria whose genomes are highly reduced, studies specify that discrete symbiotic associations can be evolutionarily stable for hundreds of millions of years. Wolbachia is an inherited obligate, intracellular infection of invertebrates containing taxa that act broadly as both parasites in arthropods and mutualists in certain roundworms. Here, we analyze the ancestry of mutualism and parasitism in Wolbachia and the evolutionary trajectory of this variation in symbiotic lifestyle with a comprehensive, phylogenomic analysis. Contrary to previous claims, we show unequivocally that the transition in lifestyle cannot be reconstructed with current methods due to long-branch attraction ({LBA}) artifacts of the distant Anaplasma and Ehrlichia outgroups. Despite the use of 1) site-heterogenous phylogenomic methods that can overcome systematic error, 2) a taxonomically rich set of taxa, and 3) statistical assessments of the genes, tree topologies, and models of evolution, we conclude that the {LBA} artifact is serious enough to afflict past and recent claims including the root lies in the middle of the Wolbachia mutualists and parasites. We show that different inference methods yield different results and high bootstrap support did not equal phylogenetic accuracy. Recombination was rare among this taxonomically diverse data set, indicating that elevated levels of recombination in Wolbachia are restricted to specific coinfecting groups. In conclusion, we attribute the inability to root the tree to rate heterogeneity between the ingroup and outgroup. Site-heterogenous models of evolution did improve the placement of aberrant taxa in the ingroup phylogeny. Finally, in the unrooted topology, the distribution of parasitism and mutualism across the tree suggests that at least two interphylum transfers shaped the origins of nematode mutualism and arthropod parasitism. We suggest that the ancestry of mutualism and parasitism is not resolvable without more suitable outgroups or complete genome sequences from all Wolbachia supergroups.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning has tended to focus more on pattern (representation) than process (persistence) and, for the former, has emphasized species and ecosystem or community diversity over genetic diversity. Here I consider how best to incorporate knowledge of evolutionary processes and the distribution of genetic diversity into conservation planning and priority setting for populations within species and for biogeographic areas within regions. Separation of genetic diversity into two dimensions, one concerned with adaptive variation and the other with neutral divergence caused by isolation, highlights different evolutionary processes and suggests alternative strategies for conservation. Planning for both species and areas should emphasize protection of historically isolated lineages (Evolutionarily Significant Units) because these cannot be recovered. By contrast, adaptive features may best be protected by maintaining the context for selection, heterogeneous landscapes, and viable populations, rather than protecting specific phenotypes. A useful strategy may be to (1) identify areas that are important to represent species and (vicariant) genetic diversity and (2) maximize within these areas the protection of contiguous environmental gradients across which selection and migration can interact to maintain population viability and (adaptive) genetic diversity.

A new database has been presented by Benton(2), who argues that the increase in diversity is exponential, that ''there is no need to assume equilibrium levels of global diversity, nor to apply logistic models to the investigation of past diversification patterns'', and that mass extinctions played no special role in the diversification of life, However, we find that diversification can be predicted by a simple model in which long periods of growth obeying a logistic equation are sporadically interrupted by brief events leading to mass extinction, The initial value of diversity immediately after a mass extinction, initial growth rate and subsequent equilibrium level determine each segment of the growth curve, The larger mass extinctions that came after long periods without one seem to have been followed by larger equilibrium levels of diversity.},

	abstract = {Bioindicators are essential for detecting environmental degradation and for assessing the success of river restoration initiatives. River restoration projects require the identification of environmental and pressure gradients that affect the river system under study and the selection of suitable indicators to assess habitat quality before, during and after restoration. We assessed the response of benthic macroinvertebrates, fish, bird and macrophyte assemblages to environmental and pressure gradients from sites situated upstream and downstream of a cofferdam on the River Odelouca, an intermittent Mediterranean river in southwest Portugal. The Odelouca will be permanently dammed in 2010. Principal Component Analyses ({PCA}) of environmental and pressure variables revealed that most variance was explained by environmental factors that clearly separated sites upstream and downstream of the partially built cofferdam. The pressure gradient describing physical impacts to the banks and channel as a result of land use change was less distinct. Redundancy Analysis revealed significant levels of explained variance to species distribution patterns in relation to environmental and pressure variables for all 4 biological assemblages. Partial Redundancy analyses revealed high levels of redundancy for {pH} between groups and that the avifauna was best associated with pressures acting upon the system. Patterns in invertebrates and fish were associated with descriptors of habitat quality, although fish distribution patterns were affected by reduced connectivity. Procrustean and {RELATE} (Mantel test) analyses gave broadly similar results and supported these findings. We give suggestions on the suitability of key indicator groups such as benthic macroinvertebrates and endemic fish species to assess in stream habitat quality and appropriate restoration measures, such as the release of peak flow patterns that mimic intermittent Mediterranean systems to combat habitat fragmentation and reduced connectivity.},

It is not yet well understood which traits are critical for pollinator attraction, although colour, shape and scent have all been implicated. 2. We conducted field-based behavioural experiments using pairwise combinations of plastic flowers differing in spectral and shape properties offered to long-proboscid tabanid flies (Philoliche aethiopica) at two sites one where the fly-pollinated orchid mimic Disa pulchra occurs with its pink-flowered model, the iris Watsonia lepida and another where the flies forage on a blue-flowered rewarding plant Agapanthus campanulatus. 3. Flies intensively visited and probed plastic flowers of colours indistinguishable in a fly vision model from those of the rewarding plants. Inflorescence architecture and brightness of plastic flowers made little difference to fly attraction, but those that matched the shape and nectar guides of Watsonia flowers were significantly more attractive. 4. Flowers of the three focal plant species are weakly scented and divergent in scent chemistry. 5. This study shows that traits that mimic, in order of importance, the spectra, shape and nectar guide patterns of flowers of rewarding plants would be under strong selection in food-deceptive orchids as they maximize attractiveness to their pollinators. Our experiments also help to explain why deceptive orchids in general often seem to match the flowers of sympatric rewarding plants more in visual attributes than in scent chemistry.},

Assortative mating by a variety of qualities, including ornamentation, is well documented in birds. Studies of assortative mating by ornaments have focused on single, highly conspicuous ornaments, but many species of birds possess multiple ornaments in both sexes. We compared ornament expressions between mates of northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) to determine if assortative mating occurred by one or more of the four ornaments displayed by both sexes. All cardinals possess tall head crests and red-orange bills. In addition, males have black face masks and entirely red body plumage, whereas females have blackish face masks and red underwing coverts. We predicted that cardinals mate assortatively by plumage color because red plumage expression has been shown to indicate quality in both sexes. We found that cardinals mate assortatively by plumage and bill color, the two ornaments colored by carotenoid pigments, but not by mask expression or crest length. Whether this mating pattern arises by mutual mate choice or intrasexual selection is not known.},

Rapid-prototyping processes enable the fabrication of according structures, but the technical exploitation requires a profound understanding of structural features and material properties regarding the generation of reflected color. This paper presents an extensive simulation of the reflectance spectra of a simplified 2D Morpho butterfly wing model by utilizing the finite-difference time-domain method. The structural parameters are optimized for reflection in a given spectral range. A comparison to simpler models, such as a plane dielectric layer stack, provides an understanding of the origin of the reflection behavior. We find that the wavelength of the reflection maximum is mainly set by the lateral dimensions of the structures. Furthermore small variations of the vertical dimensions leave the spectral position of the reflectance wavelength unchanged, potentially reducing grating effects.},

	abstract = {In many birds, nestlings exhibit brightly colored traits that are pigmented by carotenoids. Carotenoids are diet limited and also serve important health-related physiological functions. The proximate mechanisms behind the expression of these carotenoid-pigmented traits are still poorly known, especially in nestlings with sexual size dimorphism. In these nestlings, intrabrood competition levels and growth strategies likely differ between sexes, and this may in turn influence carotenoid allocation rules. We used dietary carotenoid supplementation to test whether wild marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) nestlings were carotenoid limited and whether carotenoid allocation strategies varied between sexes, which differ in their size and growth strategies. When supplemented, nestlings used the supplemental carotenoids to increase their coloration independently of their sex. We showed that the condition dependence of the carotenoid level and the response to an immune challenge (phytohemagglutinin test) differed between sexes, possibly because sexual size dimorphism influences growth strategies and/or intrabrood competition levels and access to different types of food. In this species, which often feeds on mammals, a trade-off likely exists between food quantity (energy) and quality (carotenoid content). Finally, carotenoid-based coloration expressed in marsh harrier nestlings appeared to be indicative of immune responsiveness rather than condition, therefore potentially advertising to parents nestling quality or value rather than nutritional need.},

	abstract = {To aid discrimination of mimetic cuckoo eggs, hosts of avian brood parasites would theoretically benefit by laying clutches that are more uniform in appearance and by laying clutches that differ from those of other females in the population. Support for these hypotheses is equivocal, particularly amongst studies that have utilized reflectance spectrophotometry; quantitative studies comparing clutch variation between parasitized and unparasitized host populations have supported these hypotheses, whereas experimental studies comparing clutch variation between rejector and acceptor individuals within a population generally have not. Here we extend the approach of comparing population differences in clutch variation by asking whether parasitized populations that suffer relatively higher parasitism rates, and are therefore subject to more intense selection for host defences, show lower within-clutch variation and higher between-clutch variation than populations with low parasitism rates. We used reflectance spectrophotometry to compare clutch variation in two hosts of the pallid cuckoo, Cuculus pallidus, each of which exhibits two geographically distinct subspecies that differ in parasitism rates (red wattlebirds, Anthochaera carunculata, and yellow-throated miners, Manorina flavigula). A third host species, the yellow-tufted honeyeater, Lichenostomus melanops, was included as a control. Our results do not support either hypothesis, and are consistent with experimental studies that also failed to support the hypothesis, casting doubt on the generality of these processes.

Various statistical analyses were used to define the relationship between species occurrence and 15 environmental variables and to test their influences on species distribution. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the main environmental gradients were the transitions from water surface richly covered with branches and Lemna and vegetated shoreline, which most species preferred, to open habitats with little shoreline vegetation, which only a few species preferred.

How is the distinctive whiteness produced, structurally or by means of pigmentation? To answer these questions, we have performed structural and optical investigations of the stripe pattern of a butterfly, Morpho cypris. It is found that besides the dorsal and ventral scale layers, the wing substrate also has the corresponding stripe pattern. Quantitative optical measurements and analysis using a simple model for the wing structure reveal the origin of the higher reflectance which makes the white stripe brighter.},

	abstract = {The cover scales on the wing of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart butterfly, Parides sesostris, contain gyroid-type biological photonic crystals that brightly reflect green light. A pigment, which absorbs maximally at approximately 395 nm, is immersed predominantly throughout the elaborate upper lamina. This pigment acts as a long-pass filter shaping the reflectance spectrum of the underlying photonic crystals. The additional effect of the filtering is that the spatial distribution of the scale reflectance is approximately angle-independent, leading to a stable wing pattern contrast. The spectral tuning of the original reflectance is verified by photonic band structure modelling.},

	abstract = {The ornamentation and displays on which sexual attractiveness and thus mating success are based may be complex and comprise several traits. Predicting the outcome of sexual selection on such complex phenotypes requires an understanding of both the direct operation of selection on each trait and the indirect co,consequences of selection operating directly on genetically correlated traits. Here we report the results of a quantitative genetic analysis of the ornamentation, sexual attractiveness, and mating success of male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We analyze male ornamentation both from the point of view of single ornamental traits (e.g., the area of each color) and of composite measures of the way the entire pattern is likely to be perceived by females (e.g., the mean and contrast in chroma). We demonstrate that there is substantial additive genetic variation in almost all measures of male ornamentation and that much of this variation may be Y linked. Attractiveness and mating success are positively correlated at the phenotypic and genetic level. Orange area and chroma, the area of a male's tail, and the color contrast of his pattern overall are positively correlated with attractiveness and/or mating success at the phenotypic and genetic levels. Using attractiveness and mating success as measures of fitness, we estimate gradients of linear directional sexual selection operating on each male trait and use equations of multivariate evolutionary change to predict the response of male ornamentation to this sexual selection. From these analyses, we predict that indirect selection may have important effects on the evolution of male guppy color patterns.},

Cytosine can be synthesized from cyanoacetylene and cyanate(4,5); the former precursor is produced from a spark discharge in a {CH}4/N-2 mixture(4,5) and is an abundant interstellar molecule(6). But this reaction requires relatively high concentrations of cyanate ({\textgreater}0.1 M), which are unlikely to occur in aqueous media as cyanate is hydrolysed rapidly to {CO}2 and {NH}3. An alternative route that has been explored(7) is the reaction of cyanoacetaldehyde (formed by hydrolysis of cyanoacetylene(8)) with urea. But at low concentrations of urea, this reaction produces no detectable quantities of cytosine(7). Here we show that in concentrated urea solution-such as might have been found in an evaporating lagoon or in pools on drying beaches on the early Earth-cyanoacetaldehyde reacts to form cytosine in yields of 30-50\%, from which uracil can be formed by hydrolysis. These reactions provide a plausible route to the pyrimidine bases required in the {RNA} world(9).},

	abstract = {Carnivory has evolved independently at least six times in five angiosperm orders. In spite of these independent origins, there is a remarkable morphological convergence of carnivorous plant traps and physiological convergence of mechanisms for digesting and assimilating prey. These convergent traits have made carnivorous plants model systems for addressing questions in plant molecular genetics, physiology, and evolutionary ecology. New data show that carnivorous plant genera with morphologically complex traps have higher relative rates of gene substitutions than do those with simple sticky traps. This observation suggests two alternative mechanisms for the evolution and diversification of carnivorous plant lineages. The ‘energetics hypothesis’ posits rapid morphological evolution resulting from a few changes in regulatory genes responsible for meeting the high energetic demands of active traps. The ‘predictable prey capture hypothesis’ further posits that complex traps yield more predictable and frequent prey captures. To evaluate these hypotheses, available data on the tempo and mode of carnivorous plant evolution were reviewed; patterns of prey capture by carnivorous plants were analysed; and the energetic costs and benefits of botanical carnivory were re-evaluated. Collectively, the data are more supportive of the energetics hypothesis than the predictable prey capture hypothesis. The energetics hypothesis is consistent with a phenomenological cost–benefit model for the evolution of botanical carnivory, and also accounts for data suggesting that carnivorous plants have leaf construction costs and scaling relationships among leaf traits that are substantially different from those of non-carnivorous plants.},

Now, we trained goldfish on more than one wavelength to prevent very accurate learning. In one experiment goldfish were trained on six adjacent wavelengths with equal numbers of rewards, and, thus, equal numbers of learning events. Generalization tests showed that some wavelengths were chosen more often than others. This indicated that certain spectral ranges are either more attractive or more easily remembered than others. As this is a characteristic of the "focal" colors or centers of color categories in human color vision, we interpret the findings in goldfish accordingly. We conclude (Figs. 5 and 6) that there are four categories in spectral ranges approximately coinciding with the maximal sensitivities of the four cone types, and three categories in-between. Experiments with two training colors indicate that there is no direct transition between categories analogous to human "green" and "red", but that there is a color analogous to human "yellow" in-between (Figs. 2, 3; Table 1).},

	abstract = {Modern theoretical accounts on reward-based learning are commonly based on reinforcement learning algorithms. Most noted in this context is the temporal-difference (To) algorithm in which the difference between predicted and obtained reward, the prediction-error, serves as a learning signal. Consequently, larger rewards cause bigger prediction-errors and lead to faster learning than smaller rewards. Therefore, if animals employ a neural implementation of {TD} learning, reward-magnitude should affect learning in animals accordingly. Here we test this prediction by training pigeons on a simple color-discrimination task with two pairs of colors. In each pair, correct discrimination is rewarded; in pair one with a large-reward, in pair two with a small-reward. Pigeons acquired the 'large-reward' discrimination faster than the 'small-reward' discrimination. Animal behavior and an implementation of the {TD}-algorithm yielded comparable results with respect to the difference between learning curves in the large-reward and in the small-reward conditions. We conclude that the influence of reward-magnitude on the acquisition of a simple discrimination paradigm is accurately reflected by a {TD} implementation of reinforcement learning.

It has long been recognized that the efficiency of a warning signal may be reduced if poorly defended prey (automimics) are present in the population. The handicap principle suggests that the use of warning signals by poorly defended prey may be kept in check if signaling is costly. Three mechanisms that involve signal costs have been proposed to facilitate honest warning signals in prey: go-slow behavior in predators, resource allocation trade-offs, and costs of detection alone. We study all three in a unified game-theoretical framework. We find that the go-slow mechanism and the resource allocation mechanism can introduce differential benefits and differential costs of signaling, respectively, and can support honest signaling in accordance with the handicap principle. When honest signaling is maintained by the go-slow mechanism, conspicuous prey will necessarily suffer more attacks on average than cryptic prey. In contrast, when honest signaling is maintained by the resource allocation mechanism, cryptic prey will suffer more attacks. The detection cost mechanism lacks differential costs and benefits, and its potential for maintaining honest signaling equilibria is limited. We relate our results to intra- and interspecific correlations between conspicuousness and defense.},

Here, we confirm the occurrence of the endosymbiont also in two Italian parthenogenetic populations of F candida using ultrastructural (electron microscopy) and molecular ({PCR} screening on two bacterial genes) evidence. The strain isolated in the Italian populations has almost-identical gene sequences compared to that previously isolated in other populations of F candida. In addition, we discovered a population of Folsomia cf. candida, which showed the presence of both mates and females. This population is not infected by Wolbachia. A screening of two mitochondrial. genes (Cot and Coll) showed that the bisexual population has high levels of genetic divergence in comparison with the parthenogenetic ones, even suggesting the possibility that it belongs to a different species. Furthermore, the remarkably high levels of genetic divergence between the two parthenogenetic populations suggests a possible influence of Wolbachia on inducing such differentiation, and, in the long term, speciation.

First, we collected field data on a short time-scale using the common orb-weaving spider Zygiella x-notata to determine the distribution of the size of prey caught and to quantify the relationship between web size and daily capture success. Second, we explored, with an energetic model, the consequences of an increase in web size on spider fitness. Our results showed that (i) the great majority of prey caught are quite small (body length less than 2 mm) while large prey (length greater than 10 mm) are rare, (ii) spiders cannot survive or produce eggs without catching these large but rare prey and (iii) increasing web size increases the daily number of prey caught and thus long-term survival and fecundity. Spider webs seem, therefore, designed for making the best of the rare but crucial event of catching large prey.},

Plumage coloration frequently acts as a condition-dependent signal, so that species displaying different colour patches have the potential to transmit information on condition through a multiple signalling system. The Great Tit Parus major exhibits plumage colour patches generated by the main types of colour production, some of which, particularly those based on melanins and carotenoids, are known to be related to body condition. However, the colour expressions of all of the different colour types have never been investigated simultaneously to determine whether they function as multiple signals of condition. In addition, visual perception models have never been applied to a multiple signalling system in a wild population of birds. Here I present information that links body condition with the colour expression of almost all of the different plumage patches of male Great Tits captured during the winter. Birds in better condition had greater reflectance values at short wavelengths in all plumage patches, and this was especially so in the white (i.e. structural) colour of the cheeks. Plumage colour characteristics were calculated by means of avian visual models, suggesting that Great Tits have the capacity to perceive information contained in the plumage coloration of conspecifics. These results show that short-wavelength reflectance has great potential to transmit biologically significant information on the body condition of birds, even in achromatic plumage patches.},

Recently, molecular and experimental approaches have yielded all immensely richer understanding of their diverse biological roles, resulting in a burgeoning research literature. Increasingly, commonalities and intermediates are being discovered between categories of symbionts once considered distinct: obligate mutualists that provision nutrients, facultative mutualists that provide protection against enemies or stress, and symbionts such as Wolbachia that manipulate reproductive systems. Among the most far-reaching impacts of widespread heritable symbiosis is that it may promote speciation by increasing reproductive and ecological isolation of host populations, and it: effectively,provides :I means For transfer of genetic information among host lineages. In addition, insect symbionts provide some of the extremes of cellular genomes, including the smallest and the fastest evolving, raising new questions about the limits of evolution of life.},

Thus, their expression could influence the amount of resources/energy that the mate will invest in the production of offspring, thereby optimising its reproductive fitness. The differential allocation hypothesis ({DAH}) predicts that females mated with more attractive males should lay more and better eggs. This has been explored only in few bird species with carotenoid-based traits. We tested this hypothesis in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a gallinacean with very variable laying capacity. Both sexes display carotenoid-based ornamentation that gradually fades throughout the laying period. Here, the redness of beak and eye rings of captive males was intensified after mating by means of paint. The proportion of females that laid eggs did not differ between treatments. Amongst laying females, those mated with colour-enhanced males (experimental females) tended to lay earlier and produced significantly more eggs than controls, but of similar quality (egg mass and composition). We additionally investigated whether male attractiveness influenced egg components depending on the clutch size and laying sequence. The testosterone level in eggs from experimental females was positively related to the laying order, whereas control eggs did not show any trend. Our results provided mixed support for the {DAH}, but nevertheless revealed that female red-legged partridges may adjust their breeding investment according to male carotenoid-based ornamentation.},

This is usually thought to result simply from the way that species traits associated with vulnerability, such as low reproductive rates, scale with body size. In a broad-scale analysis of extinction risk in mammals, we find two additional patterns in the size selectivity of extinction risk. First, impacts of both intrinsic and environmental factors increase sharply above a threshold body mass around 3 kilograms. Second, whereas extinction risk in smaller species is driven by environmental factors, in larger species it is driven by a combination of environmental factors and intrinsic traits. Thus, the disadvantages of large size are greater than generally recognized, and future loss of large mammal biodiversity could be far more rapid than expected.},

We tested the role of particular colours of an aposematic insect (firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus; Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae) in unlearned avoidance, learning, memory and generalization of a naive avian predator (great tit, Parus major). The wild type of the firebug is aposematic, red-and-black, and its colour mutants (white, yellow, orange) retain the same black pattern; the bug can be made artificially nonaposematic (painted uniformly brown). Wild-caught great tits avoid the firebug depending on colour, and their reaction to variously coloured prey is a result of avoidance learning and may vary according to their experience. We trained naive great tits to avoid firebugs of different colours, and then gave some birds a memory test with firebugs of the same colour and other birds a generalization test with firebugs of a different colour. Naive, hand-reared great tits showed no initial avoidance and attacked firebugs irrespective of colour. They learned to avoid all the colour forms at a similar rate. The generalization was asymmetric: birds that learned to avoid red firebugs did not generalize their experience to yellow or white mutants whereas birds that learned to avoid yellow mutants generalized their experience to red firebugs. The red colour thus represents a more effective signal than the yellow; predation by birds could have played a crucial role in selectively favoured evolutionary transitions from yellow to red coloration in pyrrhocorids.

	abstract = {One of the biologically most important parameters of the cloudy sky is the proportion P of the celestial polarization pattern available for use in animal navigation. We evaluated this parameter by measuring the polarization patterns of clear and cloudy skies using 180° (full-sky) imaging polarimetry in the red (650nm), green (550nm) and blue (450nm) ranges of the spectrum under clear and partly cloudy conditions. The resulting data were compared with the corresponding celestial polarization patterns calculated using the single-scattering Rayleigh model. We show convincingly that the pattern of the angle of polarization (e-vectors) in a clear sky continues underneath clouds if regions of the clouds and parts of the airspace between the clouds and the earth surface (being shady at the position of the observer) are directly lit by the sun. The scattering and polarization of direct sunlight on the cloud particles and in the air columns underneath the clouds result in the same e-vector pattern as that present in clear sky. This phenomenon can be exploited for animal navigation if the degree of polarization is higher than the perceptual threshold of the visual system, because the angle rather than the degree of polarization is the most important optical cue used in the polarization compass. Hence, the clouds reduce the extent of sky polarization pattern that is useful for animal orientation much less than has hitherto been assumed. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the shorter the wavelength, the greater the proportion of celestial polarization that can be used by animals under cloudy-sky conditions. As has already been suggested by others, this phenomenon may solve the ultraviolet paradox of polarization vision in insects such as hymenopterans and dipterans. The present study extends previous findings by using the technique of 180° imaging polarimetry to measure and analyse celestial polarization patterns.},

The 'alternative foraging strategy' hypothesis states that alternative colour morphs exploit different ecological niches. This hypothesis predicts that morphs differ in diet, either because foraging success on alternative prey species is morph-dependent or because differently coloured individuals exploit alternative habitats. I examined this prediction in the Barn Owl Tyto alba, a bird that varies in plumage coloration continuously from dark reddish-brown to white. On the European continent, Owls are light-coloured (subspecies T. a. alba) in the south and reddish-brown (T. a. guttata) in the north; in central Europe the two subspecies interbreed, generating many colour variants. If plumage coloration indicates alternative foraging strategies, in sympatry dark- and light-coloured owls should consume prey species that are typical of the diets of T. a. guttata and T. a. alba in allopatry, respectively. In line with this prediction, both in allopatry and in sympatry in Switzerland T. a. guttata fed primarily upon Common Voles Microtus arvalis and T. a. alba upon Wood Mice Apodemus spp. Statistical analyses suggest that morph-dependent diet did not arise from a non-random habitat distribution of owls with respect to plumage coloration. This suggests that foraging success upon alternative prey is morph-dependent.},

	abstract = {We surveyed for the presence and identity of Wolbachia in 44 species of chalcid wasps associated with 18 species of Panamanian figs. We used existing detailed knowledge of the population structures of the host wasps, as well as the ecological and evolutionary relationships among them, to explore the relevance of each of these factors to Wolbachia prevalence and mode of transmission. Fifty-nine per cent of these wasp species have Wolbachia infections, the highest proportion reported for any group of insects. Further, neither the presence nor the frequency of Wolbachia within hosts was correlated with the population structure of pollinator hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of wsp sequence data from 70 individuals representing 22 wasp species show that neither the close phylogenetic relationship nor close ecological association among host species is consistently linked to close phylogenetic affinities of the Wolbachia associated with them. Moreover, no genetic variation was detected within any Wolbachia strain from a given host species. Thus, the spread of Wolbachia within host species exceeds the rate of horizontal transmission among species and both exceed the rate of mutation of the wsp gene in Wolbachia. The presence and, in some cases, high frequency of Wolbachia infections within highly inbred species indicate that the Wolbachia either directly increase host fitness or are frequently horizontally transferred within these wasp species. However, the paucity of cospeciation of Wolbachia and their wasp hosts indicates that Wolbachia do not persist within a given host lineage for long time-periods relative to speciation times.},

	abstract = {Plumage coloration has provided important model systems for research on signal expression. Whilst it had previously been assumed that moulting provided the only mechanism to change plumage coloration, recent studies have shown plumage colours to be seasonally dynamic, with implications both for the quantification of expression and for any signalling role. However, the mechanistic processes underlying such change remain uncertain. Here, we describe within-moult shifts in expression of a carotenoid-based colour trait the yellow ventral plumage of the great tit Parus major over a nine-month timespan. We report that plumage chromaticity (colour) but not achromaticity (brightness) exhibits a marked seasonal decline, independent of sex, age or body condition, and at a constant rate across twelve environmentally heterogeneous plots within our study site. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying this change we employed a spectral reconstruction approach, that generates predicted spectra for any timepoint within the sampling period. By comparing spectra for both early and late in the moult we show that the seasonal decline in chromaticity is driven by both a marked reduction in ultraviolet ({UV}) reflectance and, to a lesser extent, loss of active carotenoid pigments. Thus, our study shows that seasonal loss of chromaticity in the great tit is driven by altered reflectance primarily in the {UV} section of the spectrum, a finding made possible by the use of spectral compartmentalisation and multi-parallel modelling to produce reconstructed spectra. Whether change in plumage coloration influences signal function will depend on the dynamics of the signalling system but it could clearly inflate patterns such as assortative mating and should be considered in studies of colour expression.},

	abstract = {Several studies have described geographic variation in plumage coloration, providing important insights into the processes of local adaptation and speciation. Given that such variation appears to be common, individuals of different origin within a single population may vary accordingly. However, as yet no study has been able to test for such origin-related differences. The population of great tits (Parus major L., 1758) on the small Dutch island of Vlieland is especially suitable for such a study, as we know of every breeding adult whether it has been born on the island or not, and if it is, where on the island it was born. Furthermore, we have previously found large differences in clutch size and survival among birds of different origin in the same population. Here, we measured the spectral reflectance of the yellow breast feathers, and found that yearling, but not older, birds born in the eastern part of the island had feathers that were of a less bright yellow and {UV} than birds born elsewhere, irrespective of where they were breeding. Interestingly, this difference in coloration among yearlings of different origin shows a remarkable similarity with the genetic differences found earlier in this population with respect to clutch size and local survival. We thus show that systematic differences in color signals may exist within populations, among individuals of different origin, and we argue that it is crucial that such variation and its potential implications be accounted for irrespective of whether these differences have a genetic or an environmental basis.},

These traits are thought to mediate species recognition, but direct experimental support is limited. It is also unclear if and how color and display behavior each may contribute to the signaling of species identity. We used a programmable robotic lizard to manipulate these signal components independently in Anolis grahami. Four robot variants were used: a control treatment that displayed the conspecific (orange) dewlap color and headbobbing sequence, 2 treatments that differed from the control only in dewlap coloration (light or dark blue), and a fourth treatment that differed from the control only in headbob display pattern (reversed headbob display structure). Artificial dewlaps were calibrated in color and brightness to the A. grahami visual system using a computational model. We presented robots to 102 adult male subjects and quantified their responses for durations of dewlap pulsing and headbob displays. Subjects spent significantly more time pulsing their dewlaps in response to control (conspecific) robot displays than to treatments that deviated from the control either in dewlap color or in headbob display structure. Our findings implicate both morphology and behavior as functional components of social signaling in A. grahami, thus underscoring the complex, multicomponent nature of anoline displays.},

In birds, the mechanisms that create these colours are diverse, but all are based on ordered arrays of melanin granules within a keratin substrate in barbules. The feathers of the grackles and allies in the family Icteridae range in appearance from matte black to iridescent. In a phylogenetic analysis of this clade, we identified several evolutionary transitions between these colour states. To describe a possible mechanistic explanation for the lability of plumage coloration, we used spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and thin-film optical modelling of the feathers of 10 icterid species from five genera, including taxa with matte black or iridescent feathers. In matte black species, melanin was densely packed in barbules, while in iridescent species, melanin granules were arranged in ordered layers around the edges of barbules. The structured arrangement of melanin granules in iridescent species created optical interfaces, which are shown by our optical models to be critical for iridescent colour production by coherent scattering. These data imply that rearrangement of melanin granules in barbules is a mechanism for shifts between black and iridescent colours, and that the relative simplicity of this mechanism may explain the lability of plumage colour state within this group.},

Imaging scatterometry demonstrated that the pigmentary colouration is diffuse whereas the structural colouration creates a directional, line-shaped far-field radiation pattern. Angle-dependent reflectance measurements demonstrated that the directional iridescence distinctly varies among closely related species. The species-dependent scale curvature determines the spatial properties of the wing iridescence. Narrow beam illumination of flat scales results in a narrow far-field iridescence pattern, but curved scales produce broadened patterns. The restricted spatial visibility of iridescence presumably plays a role in intraspecific signalling.},

The majority of studies have been based on human perception when scoring the mimicry of the parasitic egg. Surprisingly, there has been no detailed study on the recognition and sensitivity towards differently coloured parasitic eggs. We investigated effect of different colours of the experimental eggs measured by ultraviolet ({UV})-visible reflectance spectrophotometry on rejection behaviour in the song thrush (Turdus philomelos). We carried out a set of experiments with four blue model eggs representing mimetic eggs, whereas six other colours represented nonmimetic eggs. Our results revealed that two colours originally designed as a mimetic were rejected at a high rate, whereas one group of the nonmimetic was accepted. A multiple regression model of absolute differences between song thrush and experimental eggs on rejection rate showed that the level of mimicry in the {UV} and green parts of the colour spectrum significantly influenced egg rejection in the song thrush. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study showing that different colour perception by the birds can affect their responses towards the parasitic egg. These findings suggest that the combination of {UV} and visible ranges of the spectra plays a major role in the evolution of discrimination processes, as well as in the evolution of the mimicry of the parasitic egg.

They moult faster because they moult later in the season and are subject to more rapidly shortening daylengths. We tested this using a database of the plumage coloration (chroma, hue and lightness) of birds breeding in woods of different sizes, by manipulating the speed of moult in captive Blue Tits, and by counting the abundance and size of caterpillars (the major source of dietary carotenoids) in the diet of nestlings. In accordance with our hypothesis, juveniles of both species (which moult about three weeks later than adults) were about 8\% less saturated in colour (lower chroma) than adults, but there was no significant difference in chroma between habitats. However, both species did differ significantly in hue between large and small woods. Blue Tits forced to moult faster in captivity, at a rate similar to that caused by a month's delay in the start of moult, had yellow flank feathers that were 32\% less saturated in colour than those allowed to moult more slowly. Blue Tit nestlings in large woods consumed 47\% more caterpillar flesh (per gram of faecal material voided) than those in small woods, and Great Tit pulli 81\% more. When habitat effects were controlled for in {ANOVAs}, Blue Tits mated assortatively on the basis of flank hue and Great Tits on the basis of flank lightness. Flank colour therefore has the capacity to provide information about the potential quality of both habitats, and individual birds, to potential colonists and sexual partners.},

	abstract = {Avian visual sensitivity encompasses both the human visible range (400-700 nm) and also near-ultraviolet (U) wavelengths (320-400 nm) invisible to normal humans. I used reflectance spectrophotometry to assess variation in {UV} reflectance for yellow, orange and red plumage in 67 species of tanager (Passeriformes). Previous chemical studies, and my analysis of reflectance minima, suggest that carotenoids are the dominant pigments in yellow, orange and red tanager plumage. Spectra recorded over the range of wavelengths to which birds are sensitive (320-700 nm) were invariably bimodal, with both a plateau of high reflectance at longer ({\textgreater} 500 nm) wavelengths and a distinct secondary peak at {UV} ({\textless}400 nm) wavelengths. Within this overall framework, variation in {UV} reflectance was expressed within well-defined quantitative limits: (1) peak reflectance was always lower than the corresponding plateau of reflectance at longer visible wavelengths; (2) the intensity of peak reflectance declined steadily below 350 nm; (3) wavelengths of peak reflectance clustered between 350 and 370 nm. Significant correlations were detected between various measures of total reflectance in the {UV} and visible wavebands, but not between various measures of spectral location of {LTV} and visible reflectance. I propose that the strong absorption band at short visible wavelengths (similar to380-550 nm) responsible for bimodal spectra of carotenoids in vitro is also responsible for bimodal reflectance by carotenoid-based plumage colours. The construction of the {UV} and visible reflectance bands from different sides of this same absorbance band provides a mechanism for the observed covariation between {UV} and visible wavelengths. Lack of an association between the spectral locations of the {UV} and visible reflectance bands may result from the limited variation in spectral location of the {UV} band. These patterns suggest that plumage colours are subject to constraints, just as are more traditional morphological characters. (C) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.},

The costs of mating have been widely studied; however, the costs of resistance have rarely been quantified. In the Lake Eyre dragon, Ctenophorus maculosus, gravid females flip over onto their backs to prevent superfluous matings. In doing so, they compromise their camouflage as females have bright orange ventral coloration during the breeding season. Visual models confirmed that resisting females are much more conspicuous to birds, their primary predator, than unresisting females. We assessed the predation risk of female resistance via a large-scale field experiment using model female lizards. Although the flipped over, orange models were more conspicuous to visual predators, they were attacked significantly less than cryptic models. It appears that predators avoid the bright females, possibly because they do not recognize orange individuals as food or avoid rare, conspicuously colored prey. Thus, conspicuous female rejection displays may be maintained in part by apostatic selection, in which predators form a search image for and preferentially attack more common prey types.},

	abstract = {Feathers are complex, branched keratin structures that exhibit a diversity of pigmentation patterns. Feather pigments are transferred into developing feather keratinocytes from pigment cells that migrate into the tubular feather germ from the dermis. Within-feather pigment patterns are determined by differential pigmentation of keratinocytes within independent barb ridges during feather development. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine which keratinocytes receive pigment. We apply reaction-diffusion models to the growth of within-feather pigment patterns based on a realistic model of feather growth. These models accurately simulate the growth of a diversity of the within-feather pigmentation patterns found in real feathers, including a central patch, a hollo' central patch, concentric central patches, bars, chevrons, a central circular spot, rows of paired spots, and arrays of offset dots. The models can also simulate the complex transitions between distinct pigmentation patterns among feathers observed in real avian plumages, including transitions from bars to chevrons, bars to paired dots, and bars to arrays of dots. The congruence between the developmental dynamics of the simulated and observed feather patterns indicates that the reaction-diffusion models provide a realistic and accurate description of the determination of pigment pattern within avian feather follicles. The models support the hypothesis that within-feather pigmentation patterning is determined by antagonistic interactions among molecular expression gradients within the tubular follicle and feather germ.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the expression of these traits and the information they convey are still controversial. Because carotenoids are antioxidants and carotenoid-based pigmentation is bleached as a consequence of oxidative processes, it has been suggested that the pigmentation may signal antioxidant status. We tested this hypothesis in the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), a seabird that exhibits a carotenoid-based red spot on the lower mandible. The availability of a nonpigmentary antioxidant (i.e., vitamin E) to the gulls was modified before egg laying by means of a supplementary feeding experiment. During the incubation period, breeding pairs were captured to assess the intensity of the color and the size of the red bill spots. We measured the plasma level of lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity, and carotenoids. We found that males that received vitamin E supplements had larger red spot than control birds but that color intensity was not affected by the supplements. Moreover, we found that only those plasma carotenoids involved in the red coloration were affected by the antioxidant supplementation, suggesting an active mechanism to increase red coloration. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that carotenoid-based coloration reflects the bearer's antioxidant status in male gulls.},

Such carotenoid-based plumage coloration has been shown to function as an honest signal that is used in female mate choice. Despite recent interest in carotenoid-based ornamental traits, the basis for individual variation in expression of carotenoid-based plumage coloration remains incompletely understood. I tested the hypothesis that, independent of carotenoid access, food stress during molt would cause reduced expression of carotenoid pigmentation. I fed molting male House Finches Carpodacus mexicanus seed diets supplemented with either the red carotenoid pigment canthaxanthin or the yellow/orange carotenoid pigment beta -cryptoxanthin (in the form of tangerine juice). Within each diet treatment, one group of males was given restricted food access and the other group was given unrestricted food access. Carotenoid supplements were placed in water so carotenoid access was controlled independent of food access. The results indicated a strong effect of both carotenoid access and food access on color display. Some males in the beta -cryptoxanthin-supplemented group grew red plumage, suggesting that they can metabolically modify yellow pigments into red pigments, but no bird supplemented with beta -cryptoxanthin grew plumage as red as birds supplemented with canthaxanthin. Males in the unrestricted food groups grew redder and more intensely pigmented plumage than males in the restricted food groups. These observations provide the best evidence to date of an energetic cost of carotenoid utilization in the generation of colorful plumage.},

Studies that compare current and geological extinctions sometimes use metrics that confound different sources of error and reflect different features of extinction processes. The per taxon extinction rate is a standard measure in paleontology that avoids some of the pitfalls of alternative approaches. Extinction rates reported in the conservation literature are rarely accompanied by measures of uncertainty, despite many elements of the calculations being subject to considerable error. We quantify some of the most important sources of uncertainty and carry them through the arithmetic of extinction rate calculations using fuzzy numbers. The results emphasize that estimates of current and future rates rely heavily on assumptions about the tempo of extinction and on extrapolations among taxa. Available data are unlikely to be useful in measuring magnitudes or trends in current extinction rates.},

In the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), a warbler in which plumage maturation is delayed, yearling males winter in a variety of habitat types that vary in quality. Little is known regarding which physical traits allow some yearlings to occupy higher-quality sites. Here, we measured eight variables characterizing the plumage and morphology of yearling males in two habitats that differ in suitability to determine which aspects of phenotype predict winter habitat occupancy. Yearlings wintering in high-quality mangrove habitat in Jamaica had more extensive adult-like black plumage on their breast than those in low-quality scrub. No other phenotypic differences associated with winter habitat were detected. Additionally, yearling males arriving earlier on the breeding grounds in Ontario had more extensively black breasts than those arriving later. Previous studies using stable carbon isotopes have linked adult male American Redstarts' date of arrival in the breeding range with quality of their winter habitat. Our findings indicate an association between the extent of adult-like plumage and habitat occupancy, suggesting that variation in yearling males' appearance may be correlated with their ability to compete for high-quality habitat.},

Red flowers, therefore, should be relatively difficult to detect for such insects. Nevertheless, in population biological studies in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, the Sardinian island population (B. t. sassaricus) displayed significantly higher responses to red artificial flowers (in tests of innate colour choice and detectability) than several mainland populations of the same species (Chittka et al. in Cognitive ecology of pollination, pp 106-126, 2001; Popul Ecol 46:243-251, 2004): Since there is relatively little physiological data on population differences in sensory systems, we used intracellular recording to compare photoreceptor spectral sensitivity in B. t. sassaricus and the southern European and Mediterranean population, B. t. dalmatinus. The results show both populations to be {UV}-blue-green trichromats, but with a small but significant increase in long-wave sensitivity in island bees. Spectral peaks were estimated at 348, 435 and 533 nm (B. t. dalmatinus) and 347, 436 and 538 nm (B. t. sassaricus) for {UV}, blue and green receptors, respectively. There were no significant differences in {UV} and blue receptor sensitivities. We found no photoreceptors maximally sensitive to red spectral light in the Sardinian population and model calculations indicate that the behavioural population differences in colour responses cannot be directly explained by receptor population differences.},

	abstract = {Colour ornamentation in animals is exceptionally diverse, but some colours may provide better signals of individual quality or more efficient visual stimuli and, thus, be more often used as sexual signals. This may depend on physiological costs, which depend on the mechanism of colour production (e.g. exogenously acquired colouration in passerine birds appears to be most sexually dichromatic). We studied sexual dichromatism in a sample of 27 Australasian parrot species with pigment- (melanin and psittacofulvin) and structural-based colouration, to test whether some of these types of colouration are more prominent in sexual ornamentation. Unlike passerines, in which long wavelength colouration (yellow to red) usually involves exogenous and costly carotenoid pigments, yellow to red colouration in parrots is based on endogenously synthesized psittacofulvin pigments. This allows us to assess whether costly exogenous pigments are necessary for these plumage colours to have a prominent role in sexual signalling. Structural blue colouration showed the largest and most consistent sexual dichromatism, both in area and perceptually relevant chromatic differences, indicating that it is often ornamental in parrots. By contrast, we found little evidence for consistent sexual dichromatism in melanin-based colouration. Unlike passerines, yellow to red colouration was not strongly sexually dichromatic: although the area of colouration was generally larger in males, colour differences between the sexes were on average imperceptible to parrots. This is consistent with the idea that the prominent yellow to red sexual dichromatism in passerines is related to the use of carotenoid pigments, rather than resulting from sensory bias for these colours.},

Bees, the main pollinators, exhibit innate colour preferences, which have often been attributed to only one single floral colour, though most flowers display a pattern of two or several colours. The existing studies of floral colour patterns are mostly qualitative studies. Using a model of bee colour vision we quantitatively investigate two questions: whether or not component colours of floral colour patterns may mimic pollen signals, and whether or not bumblebees exhibit innate preferences for distinct parameters of naturally existing floral colour patterns. We analysed the spectral reflectances of 162 plant species with multicoloured flowers and inflorescences, distiniguishing between inner and outer colours of floral colour patterns irrespective of the particular structures so coloured. We found that: The inner colour of radially symmetrical flowers and inflorescences and of zygomorphic flowers appears less diverse to bees than the peripheral colour. The inner colour of most radial flowers and inflorescences as well as the inner colour of a large number of non-related zygomorphic flowers appears to bees to be very similar to that of pollen. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) exhibit innate preferences for two-coloured over single-coloured dummy flowers in a spontaneous choice test. Bumblebees exhibit innate preferences for dummy flowers with a large over those with a small centre area. Bumblebees exhibit innate preferences for dummy flowers with a centre colour similar to that of pollen over those with another centre colour. Our findings support the hypotheses that the inner component of floral colour patterns could be interpreted as a generalised and little recognised form of mimicry of the colour of visually displayed pollen, that bumblebees exhibit innate preferences regarding colour and size parameters of floral colour patterns, and that these correspond to visually displayed pollen. These findings together suggest a prominent role of floral colour patterns in advertisement to and guidance of naive flower visitors.},

	abstract = {Many different seabirds including terns have black color at the tip of their beak, but a yellow, orange, or red color of the rest of the beak. The tip of the beak of Arctic terns Sterna paradisaea is black, while the rest of the beak is deep red during the breeding season. We hypothesized that the black coloration of the tip of the beak is a reliable signal of phenotypic quality maintained by the costs of deposition of melanin. In this paper, we tested a number of predictions arising from this hypothesis. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that (1) Arctic terns mated assortatively with respect to beak color score; (2) early breeding adults had larger beak color scores than late breeders; (3) clutch size was larger in adults with large beak color scores; (4) adults with a small beak color scores were more likely to die in the immediate future than individuals with large scores; and (5) beak color score was related to environmental conditions at the breeding grounds, as reflected by the North Atlantic Oscillation and the amount of fertilizer used in agriculture, and hence, leaking to coastal waters and environmental conditions at the Antarctic wintering areas as reflected by the Southern Oscillation. These findings suggest that beak color score provide reliable information about individual phenotypic quality.},

	abstract = {The coevolutionary arms race between cuckoos and their hosts has famously yielded cuckoo eggs that evade host recognition and rejection by mimicking the appearance of the host's own clutch. But not all coevolutionary interactions between cuckoos and hosts have followed the same pathway. Several host species do not show egg rejection even when the cuckoo's egg looks entirely unlike their own. For example, hosts of some Australian bronze-cuckoos, Chalcites spp., routinely accept olive-brown cuckoo eggs that look very different from the speckled white eggs of their own clutch. Here we investigate the hypothesis that these cuckoo eggs are cryptic, which might explain why hosts do not remove them from their clutch. First, we use a phylogenetic analysis to show that dark bronze-cuckoo eggs are not ancestral, but instead have evolved in a group that parasitizes hosts with dark nests exclusively. Second, we show that dark bronze-cuckoo eggs are laid by two species that parasitize hosts with relatively dark nests, whereas a congeneric bronze-cuckoo species parasitizing host nests with greater ambient light levels lays a mimetic egg. Finally, we use a model of avian visual processing to show that the dark eggs of Gould's bronze-cuckoo C. russatus are cryptic in dark host nests. Our results support the hypothesis that some bronze-cuckoo species and their hosts have pursued an alternative coevolutionary trajectory, which has resulted in the evolution of cryptic, rather than mimetic, cuckoo eggs.
