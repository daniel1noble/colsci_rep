## Abstract
The colours of plants and animals have long fascinated biological scientists, but it is only recently that quantitative colour measurement techniques have become readily available. Spectrometry and digital photography are now relatively accessible and common techniques for the appraisal of biological colour, however, their rapid uptake has not been followed up by clear guidelines on which methodological details are crucial to report. We identified a number of details regarding measurement and analysis of colouration which have the potential to affect the outcomes of research. We reviewed reporting of relevant methodology in the 2013 literature on biological colour, and have outlined explicit recommendations for future research. In providing a constructive criticism of current practices, and identifying areas for improvement, we aim to better the accountability, transparency and reproducibility of colour research in the life sciences.

## Introduction
Generations of biologists have endeavored to explain the mechanisms and functions of animal and plant colouration [@thayer_concealing_1909; @poulton_colours_1890; @wallace_natural_1891]. For scientists of this discipline, identifying best practice in measuring colour and colour pattern has been a great challenge. For these biologists, identifying best practice in measuring color and color pattern has been a great challenge. Over the past 150 years, biologists have developed and adapted techniques that are now widespread, including spectrometry, photography, and visual modelling. 

The application of spectrometry to biological questions revolutionized the field [@dyck_determination_1966]. Before its widespread use, researchers assigned categorical colour descriptions, arbitrary rankings or scores [e.g. @aldrich_ecogeographic_1991; @bailey_latitudinal_1978; @wheelwright_colors_1985] or matched paint swatches or munsell chip ratings based on their own visual assessment [e.g. @burtt_analysis_1986; @key_temperature_1954]. Although no doubt applied carefully, these techniques limited progress. For example, many researchers designed colour assessment methods specifically for their projects [e.g. @aldrich_ecogeographic_1991; @bailey_latitudinal_1978] rendering data by incomparable across studies. This is especially problematic when different measurement techniques are used on the same species [e.g. the house finch _Carpodacus mexicanus_; @aldrich_origin_1978; @hill_female_1990]. Likewise, because human vision is inherently different to most other animals [@bennett_sexual_1994; @douglas_spectral_2014], its use can lead to erroneous conclusions [@bennett_sexual_1994; @endler_measurement_1990].   

Measuring reflectance spectra via spectrometry is now a reasonably inexpensive and convenient technique. Spectrometry allows the capture of quantitative and arguably repeatable data and has been rapidly taken up by researchers the field. However one drawback to this methodology, is the ease with which erroneous data can be collected if attention is not paid to finer details of spectrum capture. The angle from which spectra are taken [@santos_strong_2007], consistent calibration of light and dark standards, the distance between light source and surface, and the size, shape, glossiness or iridescence of the specimen can all potentially bias results [@andersson_quantifying_2006; @kemp_ornamental_2008; @meadows_quantifying_2011; @schaefer_birds_2008]. Experience, guidance and objectivity (e.g. double-blind experimental design) are necessary to ensure data are consistent and representative of the subject. Crucially, the conditions under which data were collected must be reported exactly to ensure repeatability.  

Complementary to spectrometry, digital photography is increasingly being used to quantify biological colouration. High-resolution cameras are inexpensive,  and allow instantaneous, repeatable sampling of multiple colour patches [@mckay_use_2013]. The main challenge for gathering colour data from photographs are in ensuring correct standardization - such as linearization - and consistent lighting [@stevens_using_2007]. Most digital cameras used for the measurement of biological colouration are consumer products designed for the human visual system. Thus hardware modifications for ultraviolet and infrared imaging are generally necessary [e.g. @stevens_colour_2013]. 

Expansion in the availability of objective methods for the measurement of colour has been matched by advances in theory and analysis. In particular, the development of sensory models has produced significant insights into the way in which colourful stimuli are perceived [@chittka_colour_1992; @endler_comparing_2005; @vorobyev_receptor_1998]. Where the receptor sensitivities of an animal’s visual system are known, the physiological response of that animal’s visual system when viewing a given colour can be predicted.  

Sensory models typically attempt to describe the subjective perception of colour or brightness information as a function of an object’s reflectance, the ambient illumination, and a receiver’s sensory system [e.g. @endler_comparing_2005; @vorobyev_receptor_1998]. These models enable researchers to move beyond purely quantitative comparisons of reflectance spectra and adopt biologically relevant perspectives of signal receivers to formulate and test hypotheses. 

Although relatively easy to implement and potentially powerful, sensory models are built on multiple assumptions about the way in which stimuli are visually and perceptually processed, and these can dramatically shape the results of a given analysis [@lind_avian_2009; @pike_preserving_2012]. For example, Vorobyev et al.’s [-@vorobyev_receptor_1998; @vorobyev_colour_2001] widely used receptor-noise model requires researchers to specify the form of receptor quantum catches (i.e. raw versus log-transformed), the use of any colour constancy mechanism (e.g. von Kries), as well as the photoreceptor signal-to-noise ratios, their relative densities, and the type of noise predominating (i.e. neural and/or receptor noise). These data are only available for a small number of species, such as humans and honeybees, and so assumptions and extrapolations are necessary when models are applied to other species. Unless the biological rationale underlying every parameter choice is clearly understood, justified, and reported, such analyses may become ineffective, especially when comparing results between studies [@pike_preserving_2012].  

Since the repeatability and transparency of science is paramount, it is imperative that we regularly and constructively reflect on our own practices [@alsheikh_public_2011; @sandve_ten_2013]. The potential for subjectivity in colour measurement and the mathematical opacity of visual models for the average biologist means that, as in any field, is it critical that methods are reported rigorously. Methods reporting should ideally have well defined standards such that sufficient detail is provided to allow comprehensive peer review, precise replication, cross-study comparison and data sharing [@alsheikh_public_2011]. The aims of this paper were to (a) review methods reporting in papers published on colour in 2013 from 22 top tier journals and (b) provide a set of recommendations for best-practice in reporting on the most common methods. Our hope is that this paper will provide a useful set of guidelines to improve the reproducibility and transparency of studies on colour.

## Ideal reporting in colour studies 

We developed a list of metrics we deemed critical to be reported for reproducibility of colour methods (Table 1) and analysis (Table 2), loosely based on Andersson and Prager [-@andersson_quantifying_2006] and Montgomerie [@montgomerie_analyzing_2006]. These included quantitative methods including spectrophotometric and photographic techniques [as in @kemp_ornamental_2008; @chiao_visualization_2009] but not qualitative methods such as the use of Munsell chips or paint swatches [as in @hogstad_gloger_2009]. For visual modeling techniques we characterized a set of criteria required for reproducing the analysis (Table 2). 

## What is reporting like in the literature? 

To determine the current state of methods reporting in the field we searched for papers from 2013 in 22 top colour science journals (_Animal Behaviour_, _Behavioral Ecology_, _Journal of Experimental Biology_, _Biology Letters_, _Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences_, _Biological Journal of the Linnean Society_, _Ethology_, _The American Naturalist_, _Ecology Letters_, _Journal of Evolutionary Biology_, _American Journal of Botany_, _Ecology and Evolution_, _Oikos_, _Ecology_, _Journal of Ecology_, _Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology_, _Current Zoology_, _Naturwissenschaften_, _New Phytologist_, _PLoS ONE_, _Evolution_, _Functional Ecology_). For each of the journals, we used the Boolean search terms 'colour*', 'color*' or 'spectra*' and searched for these in the title or abstract from each of the journal home pages. We read the titles and abstracts of each paper and included only those papers that explicitly used either a spectrophotometer or camera to quantify colour signals. We excluded papers that were: 1) review papers; 2) methodological papers; 3) papers quantifying colour pattern; and 4) papers taking microspectrophotometric measurments of retinal absorbance. To review the large number of papers returned from the searches, journals were haphazardly divided up between the authors. In order to reduce the risk of observer bias in our scoring, papers were read and reassessed by a total of three authors. Any discrepancies between the assessor scores were discussed and agreed upon prior to analysis. We then tabulated what details of the methods were reported against our criteria. The data along with analysis script can be found at: https://github.com/daniel1noble/colsci_rep (TODO: GIVE IT A DOI?). We have kept the papers used in our dataset annoymous to avoid accusing specific colleagues of inadvertant reporting. We feel that the issue of reporting is something attributable to the ambiguity and lack of guidelines in our field and not something specific to individual research groups.
 
Our search returned a total of 216 papers, however, only `r nrow(coldat)` met our criteria and were included in the final analysis. Overall, `r specs+both` studies used a spectrometer (henceforth "spec") to measure colour, while `r cam+both` used a camera. Of these studies, `r both` quantified colour using both a spec and a camera. Reporting of the make and model of the spec and camera was high (Figure 1, spectrometers = `r round(specModel, digits = 2)`% and cameras = `r round(camModel, digits = 2)`%), however, only `r round(CamLight, digits = 2)`%  and `r round(specLight, digits = 2)`% of camera and spec studies reported a light source. In addition, the number of reflectance spectra and pixels averaged were only reported in `r round(specAVG, digits = 2)`% and `r round(camAVG, digits = 2)`% of studies, respectively. Surprisingly, dark standards were only reported in `r round(drk_std, digits = 2)`% of the spec studies, while white standards were reported in `r round(white_stdspec, digits = 2)`%. Studies quantifying spectral reflectance often did not report the integration time of the spectrophotmeter (`r round(intTime, digits = 2)`%), or the angle (`r round(angle, digits = 2)`%) or distance (`r round(dist, digits = 2)`%) the probe was from the colour patch. 
	
Analysis varied across studies. Overall `r analysisType[1]` papers analyzed  data by generating colourimetric variables [i.e. 'spectral' measures of hue, saturation, and/or brightness; @montgomerie_analyzing_2006] whereas `r analysisType[4]` used visual models, `r analysisType[2]` used multiple analysis types, and `r analysisType[3]` used other forms of analysis (e.g. purely statistical analyses, such as PCA's on reflectance spectra). Of the studies quantifying colour using spectral reflectance curves `r analysisTypeSpec[1]` used colourimetric measures, `r analysisTypeSpec[2]` used multiple analyses, `r analysisTypeSpec[4]` used visual models and `r analysisTypeSpec[3]` used other forms of analysis. Studies using colourimetric measurements defined their measure of brightness, hue and/or chroma in `r round(col_def, digits = 2)`% of the studies. 

Most studies using visual models analysed their data using receptor-noise models (`r vismod_type[3]` of `r sum(vismod_type)` studies), while others used a hexagonal (`r vismod_type[1]` studies), or tetrahedral colour space (`r vismod_type[4]` studies) approach. Case specific models were used in `r vismod_type[2]` papers. Of visual modelling papers, `r round(prop_irrad, digits =2)`% reported the type of irradiance when necessary, `r round(prop_spvismod, digits = 2)`% the species modelled as a receiver, and `r round(propvis_mod_param, digits = 2)`% made explicit and complete mention of the parameters they used (e.g. cone densities, signal-to-noise ratios). The background used in visual models was reported `r round(prop_bkg, digits = 2)`% of the time. The type of receptor noise modelled was reported in only `r round(prop_noise, digits = 2)`% of the studies. Explicit mention of the type of quantum catch (`r round(prop_qcatch, digits = 2)`% of studies), or whether photoreceptor adaptation (`r round(prop_adap, digits = 2)`%) was modelled, was not common. 

While some of the values reported above seem alarming, it is important to note that papers often made reference to previous work for various methods (`r round(ref_stud, digits = 2)`%), so these figures are slightly liberal given that referenced work may have comprehensively covered some of these criteria. Despite this, many of the studies that did not reference previous work were lacking in their reporting of many aspects of our criteria suggesting the need for more comprehensive reporting of data collection and analysis methods within such studies. 

##Conclusions

Our review of recent colour literature highlights some important reporting gaps that will hinder the reproducibility of studies of biological colouration. While we recognize that journals have space limitations and that work may reference previous methological and analytical details, we strongly believe that researchers can do a better job of reporting details which are essential to the transparency and reproducibility of their work.  While all criteria are important, some deserve special attention. In particular, we found that colour scientists could do a better job reporting light sources, the numbers of pixels or spectra averaged, and the type of standards used. More importantly, the probe distance and angle should be standard reporting for all studies using spectrometry. Visual models were regularly used to analyse spectral data, something we welcome. However, there were many important aspects of the analysis that were seldom reported, including the type of quantum catch used, whether photoreceptor adaptation was modelled and the type of neural noise used in receptor-noise models. Photoreceptor densities should also be reported where possible even if using standard avian photorecptor densities. These all have important consequences on downstream analysis and the reproducibility of colour signal quantification [e.g. @kemp_ornamental_2008; @santos_comparison_2007]. It is said that a picture is worth 1000 words, and we recommend the presentation of spectral reflectance curves where possible; these figures are visually appealing and allow for the rapid assesment of the nature and quality of the data, independent of downstream processing. Surprisingly, we found that only `r round(fig, digits = 2)`% of studies using spectral reflectance data had a figure showing these curves. When possible, we also recommend that authors justify data capture and analytical approaches - something few studies we investigated explicitly outlined. 

Our objective in this paper was not to point out single studies, but to highlight an important gap in reporting that can influence the reproducibility of colour research and cross-study comparisons. By no means do we wish to say that studies lacking important details are not of significant value. Indeed, even in our own work [e.g. @umbers_bright_2013] we have failed to report important details, which in retrospect can lead to confusion about how such data were collected and analysed. This review of reporting is aimed at providing constructive criticism; it is only through critical appraisal and collegial discussion that we can identify such gaps as areas for improvement, and constructively contribute to the growth of our field. Such assessments are particularly important in an age where accountability, transparency and reproducibility are of utmost importance. 

We believe that part of the issue at hand is simply that many researchers seldom have clear guidelines to follow when undertaking research, and may overlook outlining important aspects of methodology and analysis.We hope our critical evaluation of recent literature has highlighted a need for more careful description of how colour signals have been measured and analyzed. We are optimistic that this may help establish uniform reporting guidelines for publication, and to continue the advance of an exciting era in colour research.
