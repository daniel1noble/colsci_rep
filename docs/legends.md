Information about the the capture of colour data that should be reported in studies of biological colouration, depending on the method/s used.

### Table 2
Information about the analysis of colour data that should be reported in studies of biological colouration. We offer guidelines for two of the most common analytical approaches: colorimetrics (i.e. 'specral' analyses, independent of any visual system), and visual modelling. Approaches to visual modelling are diverse, so we outline the parameters to be reported when using a colour space (e.g. tetrahedral colour space; Endler & Mielke 2005), and the receptor-noise model (Vorobyev & Osorio 1998); two of the most common methods. The necessity of parameters may vary depending on the exact method used.
