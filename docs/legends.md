### Figure 1
The comprehensiveness of methods reporting in the (a) measurement and (b) analysis of biological colouration. Data are drawn from 60 empirical papers across 22 journals. Axis labels correspond to information presented in tables 1 and 2, respectively.  Numbers above bars indicate sample size, as individual parameters may not be relevant to all studies.

### Table 1
Information about the capture of colour data that we suggest should be reported in studies of biological colouration, depending on the method/s used.

### Table 2
Information about the analysis of colour data that we suggest should be reported in studies of biological colouration. We present guidelines for two of the most common analytical approaches: colorimetrics (i.e. 'spectral' analyses, independent of any visual system), and visual modelling. Approaches to visual modelling are diverse, so the necessity of parameters may vary depending on the method used.
