Method,Information,Comment
Colorimetric (i.e. 'spectral') analyses,,
,"Definitions of spectral measures of hue, saturation, and/or brightness used","There are many commonly used measures of hue (>3) brightness, (>5) and chroma (>12) that vary in meaning, and are often poorly correlated."
,Reflectance spectra of stimuli,"Allows readers to visually inspect the nature and quality of spectral data, independent of further processing."
,,
Visual modelling (representative examples),,
(1) Colour space (specifics will vary),,
,Form of quantum catch (raw or log-transformed),"Determines whether differences in receptor stmulation are proportional to their magnitude, in accordance with the Weber-Fechner law."
,Viewer spectral sensitivity,"Defines the spectral information available to a given viewer at the earliest stage of processing. The function/s should be provided and the details for generating them described (e.g. visual pigment template, opsin lambda max/s, retinal filtering).  "
,Irradience (illuminant) spectrum,"Defines the light available to be reflected by a coloured stimulus. The spectrum should be provided, not merely described, unless it exists as a well-defined standard (e.g., D65 standard daylight)."
,Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),Models receptor adaptation to given viewing conditions. The function should be specified.
,Background reflectance,"If modelling chromatic adaptation, the background is typically what receptors are assumed to be adapted to. The spectrum should be provided, not merely described (e.g., ""average vegetation background"")."
(2) Receptor-noise model (Vorobyev 1998; Vorobyev et al. 2001),,
,Form of Qcatch (raw vs log-transform),
,Viewer spectral sensitivity (opsin lambda max & any filtering…),
,Illuminant/irradience,
,Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),
,Background reflectance,"When asking questions of discriminability at threshold, the background is often taken as the stimulus that a target is being distinguished from. As above, the spectrum should be provided, not merely described."
,Noise type (quantum and/or neural),"Noise may be modelled as being independent of ambient light intensity (i.e. 'neural' noise only; often assumed when modelling in high intensitiy light), or to also account for the random nature of photon absorbtion (i.e. 'quantum' or 'shot' noise; typically included when modelling in low light conditions)."
,Relative receptor density,Noise decreases (hence discrimination ability in that wavelength range improves) with increased relative receptor density.
,Signal-to-noise ratio of receptor/s,"Defines the amount of noise in a given receptor and, hence, partly sets the threshold for the discrimination of two coloured stimuli."
,Weber fraction in receptor/s,"Can be calculated from s/n ratios and receptor density, but we recommend reporting this also given they are often used in an unclear way."
