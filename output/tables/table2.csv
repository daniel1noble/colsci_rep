Information Reported,Reason
A) Statistical or colormetric (i.e. 'spectral') analyses,
"Define spectral measures of hue, saturation, and/or brightness used","There are many commonly used measures of hue (>3) brightness, (>5) and chroma (>12), which may be poorly correlated."
Figures of reflectance spectra,"Allows one to assess the nature and quality of spectral data, independent of further processing."
,
B) Visual modelling (representative examples),
E.g. 1) Colour space (specifics will vary),
Form of quantum catch (raw or log-transformed),"Determines whether differences in receptor stmulation are proportional to their magnitude, in accordance with the Weber-Fechner law."
Viewer spectral sensitivity (opsin lambda max & any filtering…),Defines the spectral information available to a given viewer at the earliest stage of processing.
Illuminant/irradience ,Defines the light available to be reflected by a coloured stimulus.
Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),Accounts for receptor adaptation to given viewing conditions.
Background reflectance,"If modelling chromatic adaptation, the background is typically what receptors are assumed to be adapted to."
E.g. 2) Receptor-noise model (Vorobyev 1998; Vorobyev et al. 2001),
Form of Qcatch (raw vs log-transform),As above.
Viewer spectral sensitivity (opsin lambda max & any filtering…),As above.
Illuminant/irradience,As above.
Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),As above.
Background reflectance,"If asking questions of discriminability in the wild, the background is often taken as the stimulus that a target is being distinguished from. "
Noise type (quantum and/or neural),"Determines whether modelling accounts for increased noise in low-light conditions, or assumes that noise is independent of ambient light intensity."
Relative receptor density,Noise decreases (hence discrimination ability in that wavelength range improves) with increased rrelative receptor density.
Signal-to-noise ratio (weber fraction),"Defines the amount of noise in a given receptor and, hence, sets the threshold for the discrimination of two coloured stimuli."
