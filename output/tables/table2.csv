,Reflectance spectra of stimuli,"Figures of raw or aggregated spectra allow readers to visually inspect the nature and quality of spectral data, independent of further processing.",

,"Definitions of spectral measures of hue, saturation, and/or brightness used","There are many commonly used measures of hue (>3), brightness, (>5) and chroma (>12), that vary in meaning and appropriateness.",

,"Form of quantum catch (e.g., raw or log-transformed)","Quantum catches are often transformed to approximate the perceptual scaling of colour sensation. The log transformation of quantum catch values is common, as it ensures that differences in receptor stimulation are proportional to their magnitude in accordance with the Weber-Fechner law. ","Endler & Mielke, 2005"
,Viewer sensitivity,"Photoreceptor sensitivities partly define the spectral information available to a viewer at the earliest stage of visual processing. The function(s) should ideally be provided and the details for generating them described (e.g. visual pigment template, opsin lambda max(s), optical filtering). In simple cases (e.g., without filtering), the opsin lambda max values and modelling template used may suffice. Modelling results tend to be relatively robust to subtle variation in sensitivity inputs.","Lind & Kelber, 2009"
,Illuminant/irradiance spectrum,"The illuminant defines the light available to be reflected by a stimulus, and thus partly defines the radiance spectrum arriving at a viewer’s eye. The spectrum should be provided, not merely described, unless it exists as a well-defined standard in which case it should be indicated (e.g., D65 standard daylight).",
,"Chromatic adaptation (i.e., von Kries transformation)","Chromatic adaptation refers to the independent normalisation of receptor mechanisms to average viewing conditions. In many cases, the modelling of von Kries adaptation (typically assuming a uniform response to the background across photoreceptor types) will have no effect on results as it will simply shift the absolute position of points in a colour space. It may, however, influence results when analyzing a given stimulus against different viewing backgrounds, or when incomplete adaptation is modelled. ","Kelber et al., 2003; Vorobyev et al. 2001"
,Background,"If modelling chromatic adaptation, the background is typically what receptors are assumed to be adapted to. When asking questions of discriminability at threshold, the background is often taken as the scene that a focal stimulus is being distinguished from, and will thus fundamentally shape results. The spectrum or spectra should be provided with raw data, not merely described (e.g., ""average vegetation background"").",
,Noise type (quantum and/or neural),"Noise may be modelled as being independent of ambient light intensity (i.e. 'neural' noise only; often assumed when modelling in high intensity light), or to also account for the random nature of photon absorption (i.e. 'quantum' or 'shot' noise; typically included when modelling in low light conditions). The effect of the type of noise chosen will thus in large part depend on the modelled light levels, both of which should be reported.","Vorobyev & Osorio, 1998"
,Relative receptor density,"Noise decreases (hence, modelled discrimination ability in that wavelength range improves) with increased relative receptor density.","Lind & Kelber, 2009;"
,Signal-to-noise ratio of receptor(s),"Defines the amount of noise in a given receptor and, hence, partly sets the threshold for the discrimination of two coloured stimuli. Results are particularly sensitive to variation in the relative noise in receptor channels.","Lind & Kelber, 2009; Vorobyev & Osorio, 1998"
,Weber fraction in receptor(s),"Weber fractions can be calculated from signal-to-noise ratios and relative receptor densities, but we recommend reporting this also given they are often used in an unclear way.","Vorobyev & Osorio, 1998"
