Information Reported,Why it should be included (Why it's needed for replicating the study) /,How it can affect data?,
A) Statistical or colormetric analyses,,,
"Define spectral measures of hue, saturation, and/or brightness used","There are MANY (often very poorly correlated!) (>3) different measures of brightness, (>5) hue and (>12) chroma; in particular definistions of what ""brightness"" is can differ pretty wildly (between total sum reflected light, to average relfectance over the range)","Affects colormetric variables (brightness, hue, chroma)","Affects the measurment of brightness, hue, chroma obtained from spectral reflectance curves or photography"
Spectral reflectance curves,Allows one to assess the quality of spectral data used for downstream analyses,,
,,,
B) Visual modelling (representative examples),,,
EG1 - Colour space (specifics will vary),,,
Form of Qcatch (raw vs log-transform),catch obeys weber-fechner,can fuck things way up,
Viewer spectral sensitivity (opsin lambda max & any filtering…),,,
Illuminant/irradience,,,
Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),,,
Background (if using chromatic adaptation),,,
EG2 - Receptor-Noise (Vorobyev & Osorio __),,,
Form of Qcatch (raw vs log-transform),catch obeys weber-fechner,"can fuck things way up. If not transformed, variance will be overestimated near the faces of the colour space & will mess with yo' JND's",
Viewer spectral sensitivity (opsin lambda max & any filtering…),,Obviously dramatically influences predictions re: discrimination,
Illuminant/irradience,,Remember both colour and brightness are important here,
Chromatic adaptation (e.g. von Kries),,,
Background ,,,
Noise type (quantum and/or neural),,,
Relative receptor density,,Noise decreases (hence discrimination ability in that wavelength ranges increases) with increased receptor density,
Signal-to-noise ratio (weber fraction),,,
