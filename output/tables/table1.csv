Information Reported,Why it should be included (Why it's needed for replicating the study) /,How it can affect data?A) Photography,,Camera type,Different camera types have different algorithms for interpreting light avilable,"Affects colormetric variables (brightness, hue, chroma)"Camera lens/filters,Filters and lens' affect the wavelengths of light reaching the image sensor in the camera,Most aspects of image capture.Lighting conditions,Reflectance obtained is dependent on the available luminance,Florescent or yellow lighting will affect the cameras perception of relative brightness of different colours; if doign uv photography the strength of UV emmision in the irradience profile will affect brightness of this part of the spectrum c.f. to visible.Software for processing images,Different software programs have diffferent capabilities and the reader should not have to deduce which program was used.,Number of pixels averaged,"Pixel number is a ciritcal part of sampling design. The more pixels sampled the greater the potential for variation in the data, it is indicative of the breadth of the area included in analysis and such choices must be clarified",Colour / white standard,"Allows for correction of photos under varying lighting conditions, should be included as a positive control where ever possible.",See Lighting Conditions,,B) Spectrophometric Measurements,,Spectrophotmeter type,"Different spectrometers measure reflectance on different scales, sensitivies across different wavelengths",Reflectance curves can vary with spec model (CAN IT REALLY?? YES)Light source or lighting conditions,Reflectance obtained is dependent on the available luminance,Affects brightness of reflectance curves and wavelengths that can actually be measuredWhite/dark standard,Calibration for spectral reflectance curves.,"Affects your reflectance curves, especially brightness, (& combarailiity (?) between studies); (RD some commonly used white standards such as clean white chalk or filter paper do not reflect as uniformly across the whole range as is asumed (I have some specs on this if you want it))"Software for spectral capture,To replicate the study with the same software.,Number of spectra averaged,More accurate representation of overall spectral reflectance of a patch,"Affects the precision of your spectral reflectance curves, reduces noise"Integration time / box car,Affects the amount of light used to derive a given measurment,Affects your measure of brightness and smoothness of your curveAngle of spectral measurement,"Direction of incoming light affects the direction of returning light and is particularly important for structural colours, or shiny surfaces that might reflect some glare such as waxy fruits","Affects your entire reflectance curves; Santos and Lumeij showed differences in the reflectance curves taken at different angles, and that these differences can affect the result of analysis / conclusion of the study""Distance between light source and measurment surface, & collector",Affects the intensity of reflected light,Affects brightness measures (Guessing it could also affect 'colour' too if everything is too close and you differentially saturate channels?. I know this can happen while grabbing JAZ irradiences)
