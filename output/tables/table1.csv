,Lighting conditions,"The stability and intensity of light across wavebands may affect results to varying degrees, depending on a study’s objective. For the recovery of spectral radiance (the product of spectral illumination and surface reflectance) under natural daylight, for example, repeated calibration (i.e., linearisation and equalisation) against the light source may be essential. In contrast, for the recovery of reflectance data, the light source may have little effect as long as it is sufficiently stable and intense across relevant wavebands.",
,Colour standards,"Standards allow for the recovery of parameters of interest under varying lighting conditions, yet may differ considerably in their quality and comprehensiveness. Single light and dark standards, for example, are inadequate when outputs require linearisation and equalisation. Such cases require a larger set (ideally >5) of calibrated grey standards. Similarly, if attempting to estimate a camera’s sensitivities, a large set of chromatic standards of known reflectance may be required.   ","Bergman & Beehner, 2008"
,Camera model,"Cameras vary in the details of their construction (e.g., pixel size and gap), and manufacturers often provide useful information that may be easily found given knowledge of a camera’s make and model.",
,Camera optics,"A camera’s optics (e.g., lenses and optical filters) may shape results in several ways. For one, the optics in part define its sensitivity as they may selectively filter the light reaching the sensors. This is particularly relevant when studying objects with a UV component, for example, as standard glass lenses strongly filter UV light. Light may also not be uniformly transmitted across the lens surface, which will over- and under-represent the intensity of pixels depending on their location in an image. Lower quality optics may also introduce spherical and, of particular concern, chromatic aberration.","Ray, 2002"
,Resolution,"Higher resolution images capture finer-scale detail. Depending of the object of interest, low pixel resolution (< 5 megapixel) images may miss important information, though most modern consumer-grade cameras capture relatively high resolution images by default. ",
,Sensor spectral sensitivities,"The precise sensitivities of a camera’s sensors are only required in limited circumstances, such as when mapping from camera-dependent outputs (RGB) to the sensitivities of an animal’s visual system. The broad sensitivity range of a camera, however, may be detailed by manufacturers and would be valuable to report, particularly when studying UV reflective stimuli. Any sensor modifications (such as the removal of hot-mirrors) should also be reported. ","Pike, 2011"
,Exposure,"Exposure is jointly determined by aperture, shutter speed, and ISO speed, all of which we suggest be reported. Camera calibration (hence, recorded values) may vary significantly with exposure – especially aperture - which necessitates either close control of a camera’s exposure settings, or repeated re-calibration. Variation in recorded values may be exacerbated by variation in aperture, as larger apertures allow in more light from the edge of a lens where chromatic and spherical aberrations – if present – will be more pronounced. Slower shutter speeds may negatively affect accuracy if samples move or the light source changes (e.g., in daylight).",
,White balance,"Automatic white-balancing is ubiquitous, but it is implemented differently across cameras and will often produce data in which outputs (e.g., RGB values) are incorrectly weighted. It is particularly problematic when using compressed file formats (e.g., JPEG) as white-balance cannot be subsequently adjusted. ",
,Output file format,"Compressed file formats (e.g., JPEG) may introduce chromatic and spatial artifacts to images, whereas uncompressed formats (i.e., TIFF and RAW) typically do not. The loss of information may be especially pronounced when studying fine-scale spatial and/or chromatic detail, though when studying large objects or averaging values across large image areas, the error introduced by file compression may be negligible. If compressed file formats are used, or compression is subsequently used during processing, the level of compression should be reported when possible so that the degree of error introduced may, in part, be estimated.","Bergman & Beehner, 2008"
,Software for image processing,"There may be variation between programs, and between versions of individual programs, in the implementation of methods (e.g., some programs have camera-specific profiles for interpreting file formats). This may also affect results in cases where software bugs are known or are subsequently discovered.",
,Linearisation of sensor outputs ,"The colour channel outputs of cameras are often not linearly related to intensity, which is a requirement for quantitative image analysis. Channel outputs may therefore require independent linearisation, and there are several methods to achieve this. ","Garcia et al., 2013"
,Equalisation of sensor outputs ,"Colour channel outputs may not be equal, as cameras often show a wavelength bias which can lead to the over- and under-representation of certain colours in an image. For most purposes this will need to be corrected through a simple equalisation process, though there are circumstances - such as when values are being mapped directly to another colour space and the camera’s sensor sensitivities are known – where equalisation may be largely unnecessary.",
,Pixel sampling,"Along with image resolution, pixel sampling choices will influence the level of spatial detail captured, and variation in the data. The number of pixels averaged when sampling an area, the number of pixels per unit area, and the size of the sampled area should ideally be reported. ",

,Light source,"Higher intensity light results in lower noise, though a light source with sufficient stability and intensity across relevant wavebands should produce comparable results. However, error may be introduced when using a variable source (e.g., daylight), when comparing results from a column and a diffuse light source, or when the distance from the light source is significant (as noise increases with distance).   ",
,"Light source, object, and collector geometry","The angular relationship between the probe(s) and focal object may dramatically affect the recorded spectra, particularly for iridescent, glossy, and irregularly shaped objects. The distance between the light source and focal object will alter the intensity of the light source and, hence, accuracy (with higher intensity light resulting in less noise). Probe distances will also partly define the size of the area being sampled, so we suggest both distances and angles be reported.","Boyaci, 2006; Meadows et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2007"
,White/dark standard,"Reflectance is a relative measure, and is dependent on the white and dark standards used in a given study. If calibrated standards are used, then results should be accurate and invariant. Uncalibrated standards, however, may introduce error. ",
,Spectrometer type and model,"Spectrometers vary in their spectral sensitivity, wavelength resolution, and method (e.g., scanning, multi-channel, and hyperspectral). Manufacturers often provide useful information that may be easily found with knowledge of an instrument’s make and model.",
,Fiber diameter,"The aperture of modern spectrometers is defined by the cross-sectional area of the fiber. Larger fibers thus increase sensitivity at the cost of decreased resolution. For many broadly-reflecting natural spectra the results will be minimally affected by diameter variation, though considerable variation may arise when measuring objects with narrow spectral peaks, such as many structurally coloured animals.   ","Akkaynak, 2014"
,Software for spectral capture,"There may be variation between programs, and between versions of individual programs, in the implementation of methods. This may affect results in cases where software bugs are known or are subsequently discovered.",
,Integration time ,"This sets the period of time over which the light detected by the spectrometer’s charge-coupled device (CCD) array is summed (analogous to a camera’s shutter speed). Higher integration times improve sensitivity, but may negatively affect accuracy if samples move, the light source changes (e.g., in daylight), or if channels become saturated. If a specialized light source is used, as is typical in studies measuring the reflectance of biological materials, then intensity is generally not a concern and integration times may be short (e.g., ~50 ms).   ",
,Boxcar width,"The boxcar width defines the number of adjacent pixels on the spectrometer’s CCD array being averaged (i.e., the number of points in the moving average). Larger widths will improve accuracy through the reduction of noise, but will also reduce precision as spectral resolution is effectively lowered through channel averaging. Larger widths will also slightly increase sensitivity, though not as much as longer integration times. Error may be introduced if excessive smoothing is applied, though since natural spectra are generally smooth, modest values (ca. 10) tend to give sound results.",
,Number of spectra averaged,"Averaging spectral scans improves accuracy through the reduction of noise, and also slightly increases sensitivity.  ","Dalrymple et al., 2014"
,Post-capture processing,"Common post-capture manipulations of spectral data include smoothing, binning, and the correction of negative values (e.g., through zeroing, or the uniform addition of a minimum value). Each of these may affect both the accuracy and/or precision of measures, so all processing – along with relevant parameters (e.g., the value of alpha when LOESS smoothing) - should ideally be reported.",
