## Stuff to do:

- [X] Add todo list - is this useful?
- [ ] Flesh out analysis guidelines table (table 2 on google docs) and add it to repo [TOM]. Am I right in understanding that we'll have two 'guidelines' tables (table 1 = measurement reporting guidelines, table 2 = analysis guidelines?) 
- [ ] Tighten the intro right up [TOM]
- [ ] Make sure Kate knows how to use github? [TEAM]
